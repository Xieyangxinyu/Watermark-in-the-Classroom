For the <quote> in Russia in 1905, the main contradiction facing them was, given the innate value of human life, how could they reconcile themselves to assassinating the leaders of the Cszarist r\u00e9gime?

Both characters contend that politicizing revolt strips it of its nature as a rejection of the absurd.\n\nIn 'Les Justes', Dora reflects that it is easier to die for life's contradictions than to live with them. The 1905 Russian revolutionaries faced the dilemma of reconciling the innate value of human life with the assassination of Czarist leaders. Stepan, a nihilist revolutionary echoed by French Communists in their later criticisms of 'L'homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9', contends that Kaliayev should have thrown the bomb despite saving two children, thus preventing further starvation. Dora counters that if Kaliayev had thrown the bomb, the Organization would lose support.\n\nDora embodies Camus' notion of 'la mesure' by emphasizing that the revolutionaries justify their killings by focusing on the ideas represented by the Grand Duke, thus forgetting his humanity. Kaliayev's excitement about the bomb underscores the shifting values. In Act IV, Skowatov questions Kaliayev's innocence when the Grand Duchess implies that the children are equally unjust, highlighting the ambiguity of innocence.

In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is a characteristic that coexists with duplicity.

This involves refusing to accept life's absurdity and attempting to rebel against it through duplicity.\n\n\"La Chute\" explores various types of guilt, assigned to different individuals. Clarence, for instance, is guilty. Previously a lawyer in Paris, his life seemed outwardly innocent and unified, though it was actually duplicitous. Upon hearing a scream on the bridge, which evokes memories of his 'fall', Clarence realizes that his former life was indeed guilty and hypocritical.

Unable to rid himself of his guilt, he travels to Amsterdam, a symbolically 'guilty' place due to its Nazi atrocities. There, he adopts the role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent', intending to exorcize his guilt by displaying it to others and reclaiming his sense of superiority, thus judging them instead.

The way in which he portrays Caligula shows the perversion of the attributes expressed in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" as desirable. although he in many ways epitomises the Absurd man, as Camus describes him, Caligula's way of dealing with the discovery of the futility of life is a warning of acting in an absolute way. Cherea is used by Camus as a counter-balance to Caligula's absolute nature, and although he is not illogical, he realises the value of life and is therefore suggested to be right.\nFollowing the death of Drusilla, Caligula has learnt the true nature of man's existence: <quote>. Man's mortality is now painfully clear to him, as is the futility of his life. And so Caligula has understood the absurdity of our condition; the fact that we can never possess the world and never have full clarity leaves him with a sense of anguish. However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it. Throughout the play, Caligula's reaction to the discovery of the Absurd is to try and carry out the impossible, thereby changing the nature of the universe, and making man mortal and therefore happy. This is symbolised by his quest for the moon, and he tells Helicon right at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory is quite logical, the impossible possession of the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and could therefore change man's condition. However, the reality is that Caligula can never make man mortal, and so unable to avoid death, he becomes death. This is a more concrete aspect of Caligula's logic; he cannot change his situation, and so instead resolves to inflict his anguish on everyone else. He does this by revealing death to them, by showing them the futility of life and their mortality. <|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In his play \"Caligula,\" Camus revisits the questions he raised in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" regarding the absurdity of life and our acceptance of it. Camus portrays Caligula as the embodiment of the Absurd man, as described in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe.\" However, Caligula's extreme response to the futility of life serves as a cautionary tale about acting absolutely. Cherea, acting as a foil to Caligula's absolute nature, recognizes the value of life and is thus suggested to be right.\n\nFollowing the death of Drusilla, Caligula faces the true nature of human existence. He realizes that man is mortal and that life is ultimately futile. Unlike Sisyphus in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe,\" who finds peace in his eternal punishment, Caligula cannot accept his condition and thus cannot find happiness. Throughout the play, Caligula attempts to change the world, trying to make man mortal and happy through his quest for the moon. He believes that conquering the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and change man's condition. However, Caligula's efforts to make men mortal only lead him to confront his own mortality and embrace death. In a more literal sense, Caligula decides to impose his anguish on others, revealing the futility of life and their mortality, in an attempt to escape his own despair.\n\nCherea serves as a counterbalance to Caligula's extreme actions, representing a more logical and balanced approach to life. While Cherea acknowledges the absurdity of life, he understands the value of existence despite its inherent futility. In contrast, Caligula's inability to accept the absurdity of life leads him down a path of self-destruction. Caligula's actions, driven by his obsession with the absurd, ultimately highlight the dangers of resisting the inherent meaninglessness of life by attempting to impose one's own will on the world. Cherea, on the other hand, embodies the idea that acceptance of life's absurdity, without attempting to change it, can lead to a sense of peace and fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Caligula\" explores the theme of the absurd through the contrasting characters of Caligula and Cherea. Camus uses Caligula's extreme response to the absurdity of life as a warning about the dangers of absolute action, while Cherea represents a more balanced and accepting approach.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith.

All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula. Our own values and emotions play a large role in this right from the start when Caligula  is thought to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla. This grief although incorrectly perceived by his courtiers, perhaps makes us feel sympathy for Caligula. When his patriciens think that the young Emperor is ill or mentally disturbed we may feel sympathy for him if we areselves do not like being unwell.\nCaligula is based on Camus' theme of the absurd, which is according to Ad\u00e8le King \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires\". From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of human existence. He murders indiscriminantly, causes famine and even kills his own lover. What man wants is to be immortal and happy, something which, with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula knows is impossible. However Caligula revolts against the absurd by trying to achieve the impossible so that <quote>. The symbol of this impossibility is the moon. Caligula thinks that if he can have the moon he will be above the gods and in charge of an empire where the impossible is king. Caligula therefore decides to be destiny - <quote>. He wants to show his people the one truth he has - that <quote>. He sets out to show them their immortality and their sadness by killing them. To a certain extent Camus manages to evoke sympathy and admiration for Caligula in that the Emperor wants to share the truth he has found about the world with his people.

Central to the play, Caligula's actions, thoughts, and words are pivotal in driving the story forward, prompting the audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for him. Our own values and emotions shape this perception from the beginning, as Caligula is initially perceived by his courtiers to be grieving the death of his sister, Drusilla\u2014a mistake that may evoke sympathy for him.\n\nCaligula's journey aligns with Camus' theme of the absurd, defined by Ad\u00e8le King as \"the insoluble opposition between what man is and what man desires.\" From Drusilla\u2019s death to his own demise, Caligula becomes acutely aware of human mortality and the futility of existence. He murders indiscriminately, causes famine, and even kills his lover, embodying the tragic realization that humans cannot achieve immortality and happiness. Despite this awareness, Caligula rebels against the absurd by attempting to attain the impossible, epitomized by his desire to possess the moon and command an empire where the impossible rules. By declaring himself destiny, Caligula aims to reveal to his people the ultimate truth he has discovered: \"one truth\" that he believes they must face to understand their own immortality and inherent sadness.\n\nThrough his efforts to impart this truth, Camus manages to evoke a degree of sympathy and admiration for Caligula. The Emperor seeks to enlighten his people, hoping they will comprehend the absurdity of existence and live more fully. Caligula's desire to share his profound awareness and help others grasp the absurdity of life ultimately drives the narrative, making his actions and motivations a focal point for the audience's emotional response.", "speed": 0.39731847230918377, "eta": "00h16m08s"}

However the way the violence is carried out, the immediate aims of the violence and the victims of this violence are all different. One common denominator however is that the violence is carried out in the name of the communists.\nThe first difference I wish to make is that regarding the target of political violence. In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on the Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands to the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.\nIn 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off. The political violence here concerns the communist leaders attempt to have Hoederer murdered by planting Hugo into Hoederer's office as his secretary. Hugo has orders to kill Hoederer.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Political violence is a significant element in both 'Les Justes' and 'Les Mains Sales,' but the methods, objectives, and victims differ. A key similarity across both works is that the violence occurs under the banner of communism.\n\nIn 'Les Justes,' political violence targets Grand Duke Sergei, a member of the Russian aristocracy in 1905. Revolutionary terrorists aim to assassinate him to undermine the oppression and hunger affecting the people, aiming for a return of lands to the populace.\n\nConversely, in 'Les Mains Sales,' the violence is an internal conflict within the communist/socialist factions of Illyria, a fictional Central European country ruled by a Fascist Regent. Hoederer, a socialist leader, desires an alliance with the Fascists. As part of his plan to undermine the coalition government, he orchestrates Hugo, an assistant with a secret directive to kill Hoederer. The political violence here is not directed at the government but involves leaders within their own party.\n\nIn summary, while both works depict political violence driven by communist motives, the targets and goals differ: assassination of a noble figure in 'Les Justes' to liberate the people, and internal assassination to manipulate power dynamics in 'Les Mains Sales.'", "speed": 0.39731847230918377, "eta": "00h16m08s"}

The singular certainty we hold is our mortality and the inevitability of death.\n\nThe awareness of the absurd may tempt one to consider suicide as a rational response to life's perceived futility. Yet, Camus vehemently opposes this idea. He argues that, as humans continually seek truth and death remains the only absolute truth, we must persist in living to embrace and persevere through this truth. <quote>", "speed": 0.39731847230918377, "eta": "00h16m08s"}

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children would then go on to Lyc\u00e9e and either to University or \"Les Grandes Ecoles\" so joining the class of the \u00e9lite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today. \nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a major concern for the later governments.

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society.

These forums allowed management (patronat), staff, and trade unions to meet to discuss business objectives and resolve disputes between different interest groups.\n\nIt is also important to note that, prior to the Fifth Republic, French unions did not possess the right to organize collectively at the workplace from 1884 to 1968. At this time, they only had the right to 'social status' as a national body. Additionally, the French union movement is organized according to ideological stances rather than professions, as in Great Britain. Consequently, French unions were historically more concerned with long-term battles aimed at creating a better and more just society rather than representing the immediate material interests of their members.\n\nThe largest union, the CGT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail), with approximately 1.2 million (and possibly more) members, has consistently had strong communist affiliations. It has maintained a hostile stance towards cooperation with the patronat, viewing its mission as the eventual destruction of capitalism. On the other hand, the CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail) adopts a more reformist approach, while the FO (Force Ouvri\u00e8re) is known for its cooperative nature.\n\nA possible reason for the historically low union membership, currently around 15% of the workforce, in France may lie in the ideological extremism of the CGT. Other factors could include fear of job loss or opposition to a very authoritative patronat. With these historical contexts in mind, we can now begin our discussion of the Fifth Republic.", "speed": 0.39731847230918377, "eta": "00h16m08s"}

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament.

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time.

Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century have been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, and the consequent ageing of the population.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have been in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, because it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't afford large families.\nThe consequence of these factors was that by the end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, as people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.\nAt the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number of old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and old people. This, and the need to build the economy, led to the influx of immigrant workers into France, with has in turn led to many of today's problems with immigrants.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Demography is the study of population and its impact on a country's society and economy.

However, both its population and power in relation to the rest of Europe have since declined. By the time of the First World War, France's population had fallen behind Germany's, which contributed to Germany's confidence in victory. In both World Wars, France lost countless men and experienced a dramatic drop in birth rates. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birth rate remained low, as people faced gloom and pessimism and could not afford large families.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, France's adult population had significantly diminished. Consequently, the birth rate suddenly surged, known as the \"Baby Boom,\" peaking between 1946 and 1964, with a 20% increase. This rise was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and family benefits, new optimism for the future, and a shift away from former Malthusian attitudes towards a more dynamic outlook. It's important to note that the birth rate had begun to rise before the end of the war, as people adopted a more carefree attitude.\n\nSimultaneously, the death rate decreased due to advances in medicine and improved living conditions. As a result, the number of elderly people steadily increased. After the war, with fewer adults to care for and fewer children, the need to rebuild the economy prompted an influx of immigrant workers into France.

For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair.

However, Voltaire's aim is not to evoke sorrow but to amuse. He writes the tragedies in such a way that they bring laughter to the reader rather than tears. While the narrative side is present, Voltaire focuses more on the philosophy he is trying to convey.\n\nIn order to address the question of philosophical optimism in *Candide*, Voltaire must prove his philosophy of rejecting the doctrine of optimism or at least attempting to slow it down. He begins the story with Candide agreeing to philosophical optimism and listening to his tutor, Dr. Pangloss, who preaches it. As the story progresses, the changes in attitudes and thoughts can develop in a way that Voltaire believes is necessary.\n\nVoltaire aims to persuade the reader that the doctrine of optimism is not valid. According to Voltaire, everything that happens in this world is not for the best, and there is too much suffering in the world for everything to be positive. He uses suffering to criticize the doctrine of optimism. The story is a continuous series of suffering and tragedy for the characters.", "speed": 0.3723436064493934, "eta": "00h15m48s"}

However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance.

We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. Pangloss then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\tThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to Lisbon.

In this, he included the suffering and misery that abound in the book. Martin, a character in the book, represents pessimism, the view that man is inherently evil and therefore seeks to do evil, and that everything that happens is for the worst. Martin enjoys bursting the bubbles of Candide's hope, which is centered on the ultimate happiness of seeing his love, Lady Cun\u00e9gonde again. It is this hope that helps him complete his long journey.\n\nConversely, Pangloss represents the optimistic theory that 'all is best in the best of all possible worlds' and that everything is connected and arranged for the best. He was Candide's tutor and steadfastly held onto this doctrine, despite his own sufferings, including hanging, flogging, and dissection. Voltaire was angered by this thinking, especially in light of recent events such as the disastrous earthquake in Lisbon, which claimed thousands of lives. Such catastrophes brought into question the idea that good always comes out of evil.\n\nEvery character in the book has endured much suffering, including Candide himself, who is blinded by his illusion of love for Lady Cun\u00e9gonde. Voltaire presented her as a desired object, the sole reason why Candide continued on his journey. However, when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed; she had changed in beauty and personality, becoming unbearable to live with. Voltaire used this to illustrate that supreme happiness was unobtainable.\n\nVoltaire also attacked the philosophy by showing that goodness and kindness are never reciprocated. For example, Jacques, an Anabaptist considered a good man, saved a sailor from drowning during a storm near Lisbon harbor. However, he himself was swept overboard with the sailor doing nothing to help. Even when Candide tried to save him, it was too late; he drowned. This showed that even acts of kindness do not guarantee reciprocal acts of goodness.", "speed": 0.3723436064493934, "eta": "00h15m48s"}

Once men lived together, their emotional capacity grew, and differences, or inequalities, began to be noted with the beginning of sexual inequality due to a sexual division of labor. This led to the formation of a simple society and the first man who enclosed a piece of land and said, \"This is mine,\" developed property law and thus initiated civilized society. Inequality hardly existed in the state of nature but grew as our faculties and experiences developed and were established and legalized by the introduction of property and eventually laws.\n\nAlthough inequality already existed, this was the 'golden age' and would have continued indefinitely without further development. Men were free and happy while they were independent. Unfortunately, the division of labor and specialization made people interdependent, and labor became necessary. This led to the invention of agriculture and further specialization with various jobs becoming more valuable and earning more. Economic inequality resulted in wealth inequality, divided the world into the rich and poor. Differences in wealth brought about further inequality in rank, social esteem, and power within society.", "speed": 0.3723436064493934, "eta": "00h15m48s"}

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\".

One will see the disappearance of all tariff barriers and customs and this in turn will allow for the free movement within Europe.\n\t\tBritain is very apprehensive. As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The British will find it very difficult to take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called \"the Continent\" - as though it were a separate entity).\n\t\tThe obvious advantage is the far wider market open to British industry and a bigger jobs market. \nBut one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could use their own currency without having to pay such things as import tax. But I feel the British would resent the use of ECU - taking away the pound would be taking away part of Britain's own identity. Is it why many British people are slow to educate themselves about the future plans, despite the fact it is being hailed as a great step forward ?\n\t\tWith the mergence of all the individual markets, paper-pushing will be reduced as there will be no more exchange controls with a single currency and the bureau de change will also become redundant. Staff that controlled customs would have to be merged into the intercontinental customs control and staffing would have to be cut down.\n\t\tAnother negative move is the plans discussed for legislation. Suggestions have been put forward for the adoption of the present system to one central legislative power for Europe as a whole. This idea does not seem acceptable to the British public. I feel if each country held onto its own system of legislation then they would also hold on to their own good feeling of identity, which would be lost under a central power.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Everyone awaits 1992 with anticipation for the introduction of the single market for the European Economic Community.

Not being formally connected to the Continent as an island, British nationalism is evident.

However, a section of firms that had relied on importing goods for Britain would be affected. The introduction of the ECU, or European Currency Unit, as a single currency within Europe, aims to simplify transactions. Firms could use the ECU for purchasing components abroad, reducing the need for import taxes. Nonetheless, many Britons feel uneasy about adopting the ECU, viewing it as an erosion of Britain's identity.\n\nWith the merging of individual markets, bureaucratic processes will be streamlined. Exchange controls will be eliminated, and the bureau de change will become obsolete. Customs officials will need to be merged into an intercontinental customs control, leading to staffing reductions.\n\nAnother concern is the proposed legislation for a single legislative system for Europe. Britons fear losing their national identity and good feelings under a centralized legislative power.

The diversity of the cultures, languages and political structures present in these nations mean that unification will lead to complex problems on national and international levels. One of the most contentious issues is the pace at which reforms should be initiated and carried out. There is a conflict between federalist nations like Germany and those who wish for a more loosely structured Europe and slower reforms, which seems to be the view of our present government in Britain.\n\tThe fears of European federalism which are expressed by many of our leading politicians and legal figures stem from the idea that the sovereignty of our Parliament is paramount. This view of the legislative supremacy was expressed by Dicey who wrote that \"...quote...\". Problems arose with Britains accession to the European Communities in 1972. By this Act Britain was argued to have limited its legislative competence in certain fields were it had handed its sovereignty to Community Institutions. However the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy meant that the British Courts were under a duty to apply the legislation made by the British Parliament.

Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "After the devastations of World War II, closer cooperation has existed among European States on all levels.

The Single European Act has led to more majority voting in European institutions, making it increasingly possible to introduce legislation in the UK to which no one here agrees. Certain rules of community law regarding rights and duties are directly effective, and it has been made clear that the courts are to apply these rules as if they were Acts of Parliament.\n\nIt is increasingly common for Parliament to legislate in a way that results in laws desired by the Community. The Community quickly reminded the Italians that a new legal order had been created and that pieces of community law would be directly applicable. In essence, the Community was reminding the Italians of the degree of sovereignty transferred.\n\nHowever, the current European writer Collins, while maintaining his support for community law and discretion, favors the power of Parliament to repeal the 1972 Act that made Britain a member. Lord Denning also agrees that if Britain wished to expressly repeal the E.C. Act, we could and would do just that. The present situation can be referred to as \"Parliamentary self-denial,\" meaning that for now, Parliament accepts the output of Brussels, but Lord Scarmann reminds us that the E.C. has legal force in Britain only because Parliament says so. He also believes that if Britain should for whatever reason want to disassociate with the Community, we could.", "speed": 0.40561643637359845, "eta": "00h13m11s"}

It is a profound one that requires attention from both the black and white communities. The African American on a predominantly white campus is the subject of racial dispute and discrimination caused by stereotypes and experiences. The way to end this race war is not to highlight the differences and segregate black students from white students, but to integrate all races together, rid campuses of their \"politics of difference.\" Leaving home for the first time to attend university is a major step in one's life.

Religion essentially formed the foundation of society in the past and continues to be an influential factor in modern-day society. However, even though it has played a crucial role in the development of societies and states, people, and countries learned through war and consequence that church and state do not mix. The founders of the Constitution recognized this lesson the hard way. They understood that the union of government and religion ultimately leads to the abuses of religious liberties and the persecution of unpopular beliefs. With this in mind, they wrote the First Amendment of the Constitution, which states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Interestingly, when the founders first drafted the First Amendment, there were no public schools. Despite this, they managed to create a law that has been used to protect the rights of American school children in all faiths.

The answer to the two aforementioned questions is a resounding no: Abortion cannot be justified as a moral act either on the part of the woman or the doctor because, in essence, it is the senseless killing of an innocent human life.", "speed": 0.4193243410806436, "eta": "00h11m29s"}

For example, someone dying of lung cancer may make their family more upset if they were alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous. Perhaps Mr. Rauscher does not consider what the sight of that pain and the family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their emotions.", "speed": 0.4193243410806436, "eta": "00h11m29s"}

If a person gains $100 in a jewelry store theft, yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away, cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $50 in medical bills, and spends another $50 for a hideout hotel room, then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole. \nHowever, the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of \"pay\" than simple dollars and cents accounting. In terms of criminal work, pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manners of loss that occur as a result.\nOne issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above. Crime, like any small business, requires an investment. One investment is time. If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify that time expenditure, then the crime has not paid. Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field. If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job, then crimes can earn less to justify time spent. If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions, then his crimes must earn more.\nOther capital investments in crime could include equiptment such as get-away cars, dynamite, weaponry, and disguises. Mafia and police pay-offs could be involved. Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting monies earned with other involved parties. A crime's income must be enough to cover all these expenditures.\nAnother type of loss to be considered is loss of mental or physical health and well being. Many times violence is a part of crime. The cost of taking a gunshot or knife in the leg is more than just the medical bills. It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again. Very few criminals have worker's compensation. The stress that comes about from constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself, and could lessen both a person's life span and enjoyment of life.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "To determine whether crime pays, one must first define what \"pays.\" For instance, if a person steals $100 worth of jewelry, but spends $10 on gas, incurs $50 in medical bills, and pays $50 for a hotel room, they end up with only $10 net gain. However, the concept of crime paying involves more than just simple financial calculations. It requires weighing the gains from crime against all forms of loss incurred.\n\nOne such loss is the investment of capital. Crime, much like any business, demands an investment of time. If the time spent planning and executing a crime does not result in enough gain to justify the time invested, the crime does not pay. For instance, if a criminal can only expect to earn a minimum wage in a legitimate job, then the crime must yield enough to justify the time spent. Conversely, if the criminal is well-educated and capable of earning well in a legal profession, their crimes must yield significantly more to make the illicit endeavors worthwhile. Other capital investments in crime could include getaway vehicles, weapons, disguises, and potential mafia pay-offs. Additionally, dealing in stolen property or contraband may require splitting earnings with other involved parties. Ultimately, a crime's income must be sufficient to cover all these expenses.\n\nAnother type of loss to consider is the impact on mental and physical well-being. Crime often involves violence, which can have devastating consequences. The cost of a gunshot wound, knife injury, or even the stress of constant risk of injury and incarceration can be substantial. These risks could lead to long-term physical injuries, which may result in a lifetime of lost income. Fewer criminals have worker's compensation, and the mental strain of living a life filled with crime can significantly reduce a person's life span and quality of life.

A healthy thing can easily be turned into a tool for disaster. So, is money the root of all evil? No.", "speed": 0.4089957826220156, "eta": "00h10m28s"}

The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on.

The key is in the definition of term money; money, or whatever a group uses as a means of barter to obtain resources, represents power. Enough money gives you the power to get whatever you need to survive, lack of money may mean you can't survive. But the \"power\" money holds encompasses more than the ability to simply provide sustenance for life. The power of having money means social status, acceptance, prestige--a place in society--can be bought also. These results of having money sound like positive benefits, and in fact may be. But there is another side to possessing money.\n\nMoney of itself is neither good nor bad. Ones's attitude about money is the deciding factor that determines what influence money has. It can be an influence for evil if the need for whatever it buys is possessing the buyer--whether that is a physical or an emotional need. The list of addictions people develop are endless; drug use, gambling and prostitution are obvious problems, but there are others more subtle. The need for material possessions can be an addictive force behind one's need for money. The need for social prestige and the privilege that comes with it can be a force driving one to want more and more money. when the need for money becomes the driving force, some people will use whatever means it takes to get it--evil or not.\n\nWanting more and more, never being satisfied, can also be termed greed. Greedy people usually have one objective; to get what they want regardless of the consequences.

If the individual is incarcerated whether for one hour or for a lifetime money will be lost on the cost of incarceration. This money may not come from the perpetrator of the crime but it will come from the individual's family, freinds and acquantances in the form of tax dollars. As the number of criminals increases so to will the tax money needed to house these individuals. \nThe moral aspect of crime for the criminal is also something to take into account. For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse and sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom. When convicted of a crime a mere \"I'm sorry\" will not undo the loss or pain already inflicted. The criminal will have to live with his or her actions as long as they live.\nThe law abiding citizen also knows that crime does not pay. When an area of a city becomes known for a high crime rate the result is a drop in the real estate value for that area. so even though an individual can try to add value to his or her real estate possessions in these areas the effect of crime will cause a direct loss of money for the law abiding citizen.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The phrase \"crime actually costs money\" is often overlooked, yet it is a common truth that deserves attention.

What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history of the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity. Nowadays, both \"feminist\" and \"feminism\" are dirty words because the cause has been misused by people who want women to be dominant rather than equal.\nSusan B. Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment in society. The ideas behind \"feminism\" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights to the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life. Rather, the more people that feel comfortable that they have a say in how their life turns out, or is lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.\nThe concept many people today have of a \"feminist\" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. But, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout at the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism then they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the dominant gender and all men should adhere to their wishes and call it feminism then they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for the radical women to get angry under, to shout from and to feel safe within.

They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week.

If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00.

Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week, and deductions for medical/dental insurance will cost them another $5.00 per week, bringing their actual take-home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to worry about deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Furthermore, the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time or for a specific number of hours each day; the criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, let's compare retirement. The criminal can retire much faster than the average worker if he/she has managed to save portions of the dollars he/she has stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30, he/she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years, the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invests half this money and earns interest, he/she could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.", "speed": 0.4089957826220156, "eta": "00h10m28s"}

Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs. Being that its a very sensitive, horrifying, and contraversal issue, its one of the less publically broadcast problem in society today. Suicide gets most of its attention only when its a well known public figure. Suicide used to be just an adult problem, but over the years suicide has decreased for all groups of people except young people <R>. Before 1960, there wasn't much literature about adolescent suicide, but after an epidemic of suicide clusters in the on-coming years and a steady rise in adolescent suicide, the media and researchers took notice <R>. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for the ages 15 through 24 jumped from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000 <R>. And in 1987, the age range of 15 through 19 rates were 10.3 alone <R>. Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>. In general, white males are the leading suicidal victims over any other race or gender, but adolescent suicide is still a major social problem for all races and genders, specifically black males and black and white females <*> <R>.\n\tDuring the years of this rise in adolescent suicide, there have been many works and studies done on this issue of adolescent suicide. These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening. There have also been many case studies done on individuals looking for the cause and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different way at looking at this problem and see the causes is to look at the problem theoretically.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Adolescent suicide is arguably the worst problem facing young people today, more so than drug abuse and crime, though these issues often receive more attention.

Historically, suicide was considered an adult problem, but over the years, the incidence among young people has risen alarmingly. Prior to 1960, there was minimal literature on adolescent suicide. However, increased awareness followed a series of suicide clusters and a persistent rise in adolescent suicides.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for individuals aged 15-24 surged from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000. By 1987, the rate for those aged 15-19 had reached 10.3 per 100,000. Notably, while white males constitute the majority of suicidal victims, adolescent suicide remains a significant issue across all races and genders, notably affecting black males and females of both races.\n\nThe rise in adolescent suicides has prompted extensive research and study. Researchers have examined the problem from various perspectives: statistical analyses, the recognition and prevention of suicide, and in-depth case studies to identify causes and effects. Theoretically analyzing the issue provides a unique lens through which to understand and address the underlying causes of adolescent suicide.

Food and shelter are fundamental needs a person must have in order to survive. A percentage of the population of the citizens of America lack these necessities. Homelessness has become an intense problem in the United States that must be solved. There is an agreement between all opposing viewpoints in government that something must be done that to combat homelessness. The necessary method to be used to understand homelessness is under careful scrutiny. Advocates for people without homes tend to get so wrapped up in the size of the homeless population that they ignore the fact that it is not right that this discrepancy exists. What is true is that in the United States it is continually growing, and action must be taken immediately to alleviate the problem.\n      People living without shelter has been a problem in America since settlers from Europe came. Coming to America meant freedom and opportunity to the early settlers. They arrived in masses to the coast penniless and with no shelter. Throughout history this trend has continued. During the 19th century, industry in this country rose to new heights. Numerous factories developed, in these factories the workers had a great insecurity about their job permanence. Unemployment became a live threat to most working Americans. Impoverished people were interpreted negatively as seen in the book Homelessness: A Sourcebook by Rick Fantasia and Maurice Isserman which states that <*>. Cheap labor was a direct result of trying to distinguish between the homeless that deserved help and the ones that did not. The cheap labor was used in industry and it provided the authorities with an excuse to limit the funds that had been designated for the poor.\n      During the middle of the 19th century there was an increased desire to help the homeless. In this movement poorhouses were established. As  with the cheap labor, poorhouses were only available to the people that were the most \"deserving\" of the poor. This attempt did not help prevent homelessness. The establishement of poorhouses only separated the general public from the people without homes to a greater extent. Tramps were part of the homeless community living in the poorhouses.

Advocates often focus heavily on the size of the homeless population, overlooking the ethical implications of this disparity in society.\n\nPeople living without shelter in America is not a new problem. Settlers from Europe who arrived penniless brought this issue with them. The struggle for shelter and security has persisted throughout history, especially during the 19th century when industrialization brought both economic growth and job insecurity.

However, these institutions only separated the public from the homeless to an even greater extent, and often marginalized those they aimed to help, including many who were labeled as tramps.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories;  accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc.  The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.  The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster.  Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.\nThe mental effect of computers is two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, etc. People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.  What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.  Granted, it is the person who \"told\" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated \"was able to do with a computer\", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict.

Usually, disease plays a role in population control. Every few years, a new disease comes along to normalize an overpopulated world. The polio vaccine stopped death in its path.\n\nThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible anymore, and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease. Thanks to Dr. Salk, we are a little more protected than we would have been before, living in a world of uncertainty.", "speed": 0.4114200642067712, "eta": "00h09m06s"}

Since the middle of the century the television has come in to our homes and changed our way of live.

Lastly, I would like to discuss how all this has affected the family. It is obvious that T.V. has changed communicating within the family. For instance, some argue it is a way to bring the family together. Everybody comes together at night to watch a favorite program. However, others say the T.V. disrupts the \"family dinner\"\n and and diminished communication among family members because they would rather watch T.V. than talk with one another.

This discovery of AIDS has changed how people think, live, and view mortality.  At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.  AIDS victims should be accepted & given the respect that they deserve.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "One of the most important discoveries of the 20th century would have to be AIDS. This discovery has fundamentally changed how people think, live, and view mortality. Initially, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease. With little tolerance for homosexuality in the early 1980s, society was largely indifferent to the impact of the disease on gay communities. This changed when it became known that intravenous (IV) drug users could also contract AIDS. Many people dismissed the threat, thinking it would never affect them.\n\nHowever, the situation took a more alarming turn when children began to be diagnosed with AIDS. Society could hardly accept that a small child could die from such a horrific disease. By the end of the 1980s, there was increased awareness of AIDS, but this awareness was accompanied by significant discrimination.\n\nOne of the first prominent cases was that of twelve-year-old hemophiliac Ryan White. His illness received widespread media attention, leading to public panic about the risk of children contracting AIDS simply by being around him. This prompted a nationwide effort to educate the public about how AIDS is transmitted. Media campaigns featuring TV, magazines, radio, and school programs emphasized this education, but controversy persists. Many parents still battle the distribution of condoms in schools and advocate for abstinence education, believing it to be the only safe way to prevent AIDS. However, given that many children are becoming sexually active at an early age, this approach is seen as unrealistic.\n\nDue to the discovery of AIDS, people are acutely aware of their mortality and the risks associated with promiscuity and unsafe sex. Society has become more conscious of its own vulnerability, and efforts have been made to find a cure for AIDS. While finding a cure remains crucial, acceptance of AIDS victims and public education are equally important. Sadly, it often takes a high-profile case, like Magic Johnson's, to capture the public's attention. Regardless, AIDS victims should be met with the respect and acceptance they deserve.", "speed": 0.4114200642067712, "eta": "00h09m06s"}

During the 1950's, America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution. The era of Populuxe instigated a `must-have' ideology in the nation and the most important `must-have' was, of course, the television. The  presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture: the mass culturization of various grupes, the commercialization of our lifestyles, and the rapidity and breath of the information that reaches us.\n\tGathered around the tube, the American family learned the `ideal' way of life. But the picture of perfection was the same in every home. We all received the same information. We all saw the same families, The Cleavers & The Andersons, etc. telling how we should behave. Mother was always beautiful, father knew best,  & children had cute, silly, harmless problems. As a result of this omniscient picture, a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of. People in N.Y. watched Green Acres. Today the same trend continues. To white people, Ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery. The examples on television are blown-up &exaggerated, but people get a general idea of different lifestyles. Rather than several small, isolated cultures, the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization\n and the presence of another's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason.\n\tAnother effect of the television on people's lives is the commercialization of our lives. Advertisements, which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options, have developed into an art form. 15 second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars and as a result the American population is made to laugh, or to cry, & often times to buy a product.\n\tFinally, & perhaps most importantly, the citizens of America have experienced w/ the advent of the television a great increase in the amount of information they receive, as well as in the time it takes to reach them. A hundred years ago, different sections of the country (and world) were isolated & separated by the time it takes to mail a letter & print a newspaper story.\n Today, we know within seconds, or in the case of the space-shuttle challenger explosion, we know live-immediately.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The television, an invention of the 0th century, has radically transformed people's lives. In the 1950s, America began a cultural revolution, marked by the Populuxe era and the widespread demand for television sets. The presence of television has initiated significant cultural trends: mass culturalization of diverse groups, commercialization of lifestyles, and rapid, widespread information dissemination.\n\nGathered around the television, the American family learned a standardized \"ideal\" way of life, depicted uniformly in every home. Shows like \"The Cleavers\" and \"The Andersons\" presented idealized family dynamics, influencing perceptions even in rural areas like Iowa, which saw \"Green Acres.\" This homogenization of cultural experiences has contributed to the nation's move towards mass culturalization, reducing the mystique of different lifestyles.\n\nTelevision also commercialized American life. Initially used to inform viewers of purchasing options, advertisements have evolved into a significant art form. Short, emotionally charged ads command millions of dollars and aim to make viewers laugh, cry, or purchase products.\n\nPerhaps most crucially, the television has dramatically increased the amount and speed of information Americans receive. Compared to a century ago, when different regions were isolated by mail and print, modern technology allows immediate global connectivity. This rapid dissemination of information was underscored by events like the Challenger explosion, where people learned about it in real-time.", "speed": 0.4114200642067712, "eta": "00h09m06s"}

The extend to which this invention has altered people's lives is astronomical.  The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people's perceptions of the entire world.  It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine: the concept of flying.\n\tBefore the invention of the airplane, long distance traveling was a very difficult, time consuming task.  For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own.  One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease, hunger, and threatening weather;  also as noted above, it was extremely time consuming.  Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world.  I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited.  I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures.  Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand.\n\tThe invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations.  Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems, and international business endeavors.  The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade.  The airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also.  Life with airplanes is more rapid paced.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the airplane, a significant innovation of the 20th century, has dramatically changed people's lives in numerous ways. The airplane has revolutionized travel, opened new horizons, and introduced the concept of flying, which was previously considered impossible for humans without machines. Prior to the airplane, long-distance travel was arduous and time-consuming, limiting opportunities for people to visit distant countries and experience cultures different from their own. Travel by boat, though possible, was fraught with dangers such as disease, hunger, and dangerous weather, and it was often inefficient.\n\nBefore the advent of air travel, people frequently had a narrow worldview due to limited exposure to diverse cultures. For instance, I learned about my own culture by visiting Spain, my only international destination. Even with news reports and books, firsthand experiences of other cultures remained inaccessible. The airplane has since opened numerous avenues, including advancements in international relations. It has allowed countries to engage more frequently in direct communication and negotiations, leading to improved international trade and a faster postal communication system. Overall, life has become more rapid-paced with the advent of air travel.", "speed": 0.4114200642067712, "eta": "00h09m06s"}

Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans;  it also kills animals & plants. We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes & rivers. Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w/o being heavily fined.\n\tPeople have also become concerned with nature. We used to assume our natural resources were never ending.

We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively.\n\tAnother important topic we are all aware of is recycling.

Recycling, even on a small scale, can also benefit those without homes, as they receive money for their collections.

Looking to the future, it's reasonable to expect that both governments and people worldwide will be less tempted to do wrong and more willing to do right, knowing that the satellite keeps a watchful eye on all of us. The biggest advantage the satellite offers is truth before censorship.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.

On the other hand, a woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children. These so called images although maybe pleasant to some people, are not always realistic. For instance a man is not always the strong backbone of the family, the culture makes him out to be. The successful business woman/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\tHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to provide both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of pressure on men, as they aspire to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become so preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them.

For example, a successful businesswoman or single mother may indeed serve as the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\nHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for boys, teaching them to be strong and providing moral and financial support for their families. However, this puts significant pressure on men to excel academically, secure high-paying jobs, and achieve career success. The pursuit of success often leads to neglect of family responsibilities, resulting in estrangement, as discussed in Warren Farrell's book \"Why Men Are the Way They Are.\" Ralph admits that his hard work to provide for his family led him to lose touch with them.\n\nThe other disadvantage of an ideal male image involves sensitivity in men. Social scientists like William Masters note that school-aged boys are generally expected to demonstrate masculinity through physical competence and bravery. They face criticism for showing fear or emotions, adhering to the notion that \"big boys don't cry.\" Boys who mistakenly display sensitivity are ridiculed and often become the primary concern of psychiatrists, who are quick to diagnose issues based on societal expectations rather than understanding the boy's genuine emotions.", "speed": 0.35406005242398636, "eta": "00h09m05s"}

Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty.

This societal pressure has severe consequences, causing various disorders that affect women's mental health and well-being.

Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch.

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of a patient's\nrecovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Society harbors a double standard for women in our culture, rooted in historical norms where women were primarily homemakers and men the sole breadwinners and heads of households. Older generations witnessed the beginnings of the feminist movement, which aimed for gender equality and emerged in the early nineteen hundreds. During this era, society was structured with men as the dominant rulers, while women were relegated to domestic roles. The notion that women could think independently and aspire for equality was met with resistance, as many men found it challenging to accept these changes.\n\nThe Bible's assertion that God created man, Adam, before Eve, was often cited to justify the male-dominant structure, portraying women as docile, fragile, and emotional beings deserving of male guidance and care. As women became restless, they sought equal opportunities in society, desiring the same freedoms as men\u2014job positions, choice in attire, and the right to vote. Men, adhering to tradition, believed in their role as providers outside the home.\n\nFeminism posits that women, too, are fully capable and intelligent human beings, and that sex discrimination is fundamentally unjust.

It didn't begin ten, twenty, or thirty-five years ago either, but premarital sex has truly changed during that time. The major change, of course, coming thirty-five years ago with the start of the \"Sexual Revolution\" in the sixties. This revolution brought about a sexual awareness. No longer was sex going to be a dark issue. Men and women became more educated about their bodies, how to prevent disease, how to better plan their families, and how to perform better in their sexual roles. Other reforms in gender and racial equality helped keep the revolution rolling. Unfortunately, as with many things, all the good things brought about by greater sexual education had there bad side affects. Side affects like the lowering of moral standards and the loss of person responsibility have made sexual revolution buzz words for when America headed down the toilet. People were given power over their sex and their sexuality, but they lost control of themselves. That power has corrupted people into thinking they can have it all for free. As far as premarital sex is involved, the idea is that \"the reward would be granted before the price was paid, and if this reward were the only thing desired why should one pay the price of marriage after enjoying intercourse\" (Reiss 175) has become prominent.

Democrats in the White House seem to think that more education and training for jobs within a two year time limit is the key.  Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, seem to think perhaps shorter time limits and cuts in spending on some welfare programs would be the answer (Silverstein 13-15).  However, the heatedly argued welfare issue can be solved by combining the ideas of both parties.  The welfare program would be successful if it changed to include a time limit, training programs that are required, less government funding for certain welfare programs, and abolishing the law that states that women should get more money for having more children.\nBoth parties agree on having time limits and training programs so that welfare recipients can find jobs (Economist 33).

With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily, the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern. Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations (Hepburn 1). Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent. Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime, psychotic murderers, police cases, emergency services, international terrorism, and war (Hepburn 1). Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children.\nThe V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows. Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show. Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised, but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager?\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence' pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1). How much violence is there? The most violent cartoons are 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', 'Spider Man', and some 'Bugs Bunny' episodes with Elmer Fudd.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Violence on television is prevalent across numerous cable channels, with an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily.

This discrepancy highlights a contradiction in our societal values, particularly when we expect 18-year-olds to fight and risk their lives. If we believe they are mature enough to bear the responsibilities and dangers of combat, should we not also consider that they are capable of handling the effects of alcohol responsibly?\n\nMany teenagers are caught in a dilemma, attempting to hide their drinking habits from their parents. The majority of these 18-to-20-year-olds are out of high school, and their parents may not be concerned with their choices. I propose that if a high school diploma signifies an ability to make mature decisions, then perhaps the legal drinking age should be aligned with educational milestones. For instance, those without a diploma and under 21 should not be permitted to drink. Encouraging graduation could lead to a broader belief that holding a diploma equates to the ability to make responsible adult decisions.\n\nAdditionally, lowering the drinking age to 18 could potentially reduce crime among teenagers. The primary crimes committed by this age group are often associated with alcohol consumption and impaired judgment, such as drinking and driving. Currently, because they are forbidden from drinking at home, many teenagers drink elsewhere to avoid detection by their parents.

One may assume that the NFL and its tax-subsidized teams no longer owe any loyalty to the fans.\n\nThe Houston Oilers will leave Houston for Nashville at the end of the 1995 season to become the Tennessee Cherokees. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Raiders returned to Oakland, and the Los Angeles Rams relocated to Anaheim to a more spacious St. Louis. Why is this happening? And now, the 54-year-old Cleveland Browns plan to leave Cleveland to become the Baltimore Browns. Is this right? Is business just business, or do fans, tradition, and loyalty count?\n\nThe City of Cleveland has been known as a \"dump city\" for over two decades! Yet, they never really cared what anyone else thought. They started beautifying the city in the late 1980s, and now the beautification process is evident. They spent $440 million on the Gateway Project to build new facilities downtown for their baseball team (The Cleveland Indians) and basketball team (The Cleveland Cavaliers). Project Gateway opened two years ago. They also spent almost $80 million on Cleveland's brand-new Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame opened this year, and they're now building a novel Science Museum located downtown. Bob Costas of NBC's sports called it, \"The Renaissance of Cleveland.\"\n\nAll of this would be shattered in just one day when Art Modell announced that he was taking the Cleveland Browns elsewhere. The fans of Cleveland didn't deserve this abdication. They were sold out for dollars and cents without even being given a chance to make a counteroffer.\"", "speed": 0.3651191500635294, "eta": "00h07m20s"}

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In an era when government funding cuts loom on the horizon, it's worth considering which areas of government expenditure might be reduced next. While defense cuts may seem appropriate given that the United States no longer faces an imminent threat from another superpower, there are other areas that should continue to receive support, such as government funding for the arts.\n\nWhy should the arts, including both visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? One compelling reason lies in the views of anthropology, which suggests that since the dawn of human civilization, humanity has sought to interpret and depict its world. This need for communication has led to the creation of lasting works, such as cave and wall drawings, which communicate the essence of early human thought. These primitive cultures' ingenuity serves as a classic model, showing us how we can leave an impression for future generations.\n\nArt also aids in our communication with each other, allowing us to express our values. For example, leaders like Louis XIV and Napoleon used the decorative arts to showcase the glory of France. These leaders aimed to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns through their patronage of the arts.\n\nIn everyday life, art helps us communicate in simple yet powerful ways. Children's drawings are a great example of this, as they often convey basic ideas in a precise, pictorial form, focusing on visual communication rather than verbal skills.\n\nMoreover, the performing and visual arts have a unifying effect on communities. Much like team sports, these arts create camaraderie and pride among participants. For example, members of a ballet troupe bond through their shared efforts to produce quality performances. Similarly, patrons of the arts who engage with art together can develop friendships and shared interests, strengthening community ties.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that government support for the arts is not just a cultural necessity but also a means of fostering communication, community, and lasting legacies.", "speed": 0.3651191500635294, "eta": "00h07m20s"}

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide.

That questions is should women be allowed to attend the Citadel. There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Over the past few years, one question that has repeatedly appeared in court is whether women should be allowed to attend the Citadel.

First, it has traditionally been an all-male institution, and some believe that women couldn't handle it. While it is true that the Citadel has historically only enrolled males, as the saying goes, traditions are meant to be broken. If we continued to adhere to outdated traditions, we would still be in a world where racial segregation, gender inequality, and other injustices persisted, such as slavery and the confinement of women to household duties. As society evolves, certain traditions fade away, making room for progress and greater equality, which benefits everyone and creates a fairer society.\n\nAlthough it might seem that society is becoming more equal, women still face significant disparities. Men and women share a wide range of characteristics, from strength to intelligence. While some men and women excel, others may not. This variation is natural and doesn't disqualify any gender from performing any task effectively. Women, like men, should have equal opportunities to pursue their aspirations, including attending the Citadel.\n\nSome argue that women lack the physical strength required for the demands of the Citadel. However, this is not a blanket statement true for all women, as some may possess the necessary strength and capability to meet these challenges. Everyone deserves the chance to try, and excluding anyone based on gender undermines the principles of equality and opportunity that are fundamental to our society.\n\nIn our country, if a school is publicly funded, it cannot discriminate against individuals based on race, religion, gender, or disabilities. The Citadel is publicly funded, therefore it must adhere to the same non-discriminatory rules as other public schools. If schools started adopting discriminatory practices similar to those seen in the past, our educational system would face chaos, requiring far more resources to manage the fallout. It is crucial for our society that we embrace diversity and equality in all aspects of life, including education.", "speed": 0.3651191500635294, "eta": "00h07m20s"}

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana.

Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite.

Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and people today are recognizing that it is an issue that will not go away.

They want to represent you if you are hurt on the job, or if you slip and fiLI1, and especially if you are involved in an automobile accident. It costs millions of tax dollars to support the system of litigation for all these lawsuits. Courthouses have to be built, judges and hundreds of administrative employees have to be paid. Jurors have to be paid, not to mention the wnount of time wasted by jurors to hear these ridiculous cases. Hundreds of lawsuits are filed by ft~tes in the prison system. They have time on their hands and law libraries at their disposal. Inmates file suits for just about everything you can imagine. For example, ft~tes have filed suit because they do not like the flavor of ice cream they are being served. bmtes have sued because they are not allowed to wear their hair the way they want to, and I heard of a case last week in which a male inmate sued the state because he was not allowed to wear female underwear during his incarceration. It costs thousands of taxpayers dollars to pay lawyers to represent the state against these frivolous lawsuits.\nThere have been several rings of accident stagers arrested recently. These people fake accidents in order to sue and collect money from insurance companies with the corporation of lawyers, chiropractors, and sometimes medical doctors. It cost you and I millions in insurance cost to payoff these fake claims. It seems as though accidents have become something to make a profit off of.

Politicians should consider examining the judicial system, particularly the Court of Common Pleas or Civil Court, to identify potential cost-saving measures. This judicial forum hears lawsuits, but are all of these lawsuits necessary? It appears that lawsuits have become a common recourse, with many people seeking legal representation for a variety of issues, from job injuries to automobile accidents. This surge in litigation requires millions of taxpayer dollars to build courthouses, pay judges and administrative staff, and compensate jurors. Moreover, hundreds of lawsuits are filed within the prison system by inmates who have ample time and access to law libraries, but these often involve trivial matters like ice cream flavors, hairstyle restrictions, or dress codes.\n\nFrivolous lawsuits driven by individuals who stage accidents to claim insurance payouts impose a significant financial burden on taxpayers and inflate insurance costs. This trend, fueled by aggressive advertising from lawyers on television, radio, and billboards, exacerbates the problem, suggesting that some people view accidents merely as opportunities for profit.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people.

Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\".

To an extent, I think that characters in all of the works covered over the semester are victims of forces inside and outside themselves. It is usualy only through force-of-will that characters break free from the circumstances of their naturalistic lines.\nAs is necessary for a literature to be considerred \"ethnic\", a seperate culture must be delt with. And aspects of these different cultures have different naturalistic implications. Take, for instance, the Chippewa tribal and religious structures that define the conflicts of the characters in Erdrich's Love Medicine. The effects of these conflicting elements have devious effects on the confused lives of Nectar, Marie, Albertine, Henry Jr, and June. Each of these characters battles against the naturalistic effects of white versus Native American thinking. should they form a tribal family, or a nuclear one? should they worship God, or Gods?

These two mottos seem two conflict but they do not. Both are true but the second one has to be embraced and understood before the first motto can become a reality. In America, there are real characteristics that are unique to each race that every American needs to come to understand an accept. Ethnic American literature is bridge that all American can use to help them come to an understanding and acceptance of people of other backgrounds. If oneday America as a whole is enlightened in this manner, then we can honestly say our national motto is \"from the many, one!\" Ethnic American lit. can help us accomplish this goal because it helps us to understand.\nEthnic American Literature will help each group of people understand what the other group of people has gone through. Every single ethnic group has suffered a great amount in their attempt to gain equality. That suffering they have gone through has left many wounds that have not totally healed. Knowing why those wounds are there help to clearify why people do the thing that they do today. Ethnic American literature explains why those wounds are there and usually the literature presents to the people a way to overcome the wounds. For example, in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club the Chinese American daughters have a tough time understanding themselves because they are caught between two cultures that clash in values. The girls are the victims of the clash because they do not know which culture to follow. The Chinese culture gives them no choices, and the American culture gives them too many choices. Consequently, the girls are lost and do not know who they are. Ian advises that they should listen to their mothers. When the girls listen to their mothers they find out who they are. From reading this book, I have become more sympathetic to the Chinese-American's dilemna.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The national motto is \"E pluribus unum,\" and ethnic American literature teaches that \"From the many, one.\" These two mottos may seem to be in conflict, but they are truly compatible. Both are valid and interrelated. Ethnic American literature serves as a bridge, helping Americans from diverse backgrounds to come to understand and accept one another. By embracing and understanding this literature, we can move closer to realizing the national motto that \"one\" emerges from \"many.\" \n\nEthnic American literature provides insight into the unique experiences and struggles of various ethnic groups, helping each group understand the other. These groups have endured significant challenges in their pursuit of equality, leaving many unhealed wounds. Understanding these wounds explains why people act the way they do today. Ethnic American literature not only elucidates these wounds but often offers solutions for overcoming them.\n\nFor instance, in Amy Tan's \"The Joy Luck Club,\" the Chinese American daughters face difficulties in understanding themselves due to a clash between the values of their Chinese heritage and their American upbringing. The daughters are victims of this cultural clash, caught between two conflicting cultures without a clear path forward. Through listening to their mothers, they eventually discover their identities. This book has made me more empathetic towards the Chinese-American experience.\n\nIn essence, ethnic American literature bridges the gap between diverse cultures, fostering understanding and acceptance. By embracing this literature, we can make strides toward realizing America's national motto, \"E pluribus unum,\" or \"From the many, one.\"", "speed": 0.3651191500635294, "eta": "00h07m20s"}

She is born into society that is trying to crush her and any self-respect she might have because she is black, and female. She is thought of as and treated as nothing. Therefore she naturally thinks of herself as nothing. Walker shows African Americans that they must find a self-understanding that is void of the standards that were and are imposed upon them by the white race.

However, Zaitchik seems unaware that because the \"classics\" were predominantly written and curated by white European males, they are just as ethno-centric as the works we have studied in this semester. Far from being mere \"guides to a better life,\" I would argue that it is hard to find anyone who does not admire the inner strength of characters like Tita or Celie, the integrity of Marie Lazare, the loyalty to culture of Marso, the tolerance of Violet, the wisdom of Eli, Nectar, or Zulu, or the reverence for life found in the original members of the Joy Luck Club.", "speed": 0.36272113875156453, "eta": "00h05m55s"}

In Lisbon, a grand auto-da-f\u00e9 is planned to quell the fear of earthquakes, yet the execution of only a few people on the pyre is insufficient. Meanwhile, outside of Surinam, a black man suffers a tragic fate after his hand and leg are severed due to a sugar mill accident and his subsequent escape attempt, respectively. In England, an admiral's life is cut short for not exterminating enough enemies, while in Paris, Martin is wrongfully accused of theft. Religion is also mocked, as seen in the tragic drowning of James the Anabaptist, who was saved by the saintly man but ultimately perished in a shipwreck while attempting to rescue another.

The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around.

The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years.

Aversive racism, where a person who dislikes a certain minority avoids associating with them to suppress their prejudices, is one such form. Symbolic racism, another contemporary prejudice, involves equating a group with a social issue, such as the stereotype that all welfare recipients are black, which unfairly labels blacks as lazy. Ironically, most welfare recipients are actually white. Over the past thirty years, racial prejudice has declined, and acceptance of various races has increased.

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities.

The factors involved in this occurrence are mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more likely to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrollably and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\n\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table.\" People who are prejudiced may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually result in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individuals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptably.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing.

Back then, people didn't have to justify or hide their prejudiced views; they simply expressed them openly. However, in contemporary society, people find it increasingly difficult to openly express such prejudices. They must now justify their actions to themselves and others. For example, a study found that while students were just as likely to help black and white students who demonstrated effort, they quickly disqualified black students' assistance when they did not, attributing it to laziness or lack of care. If the white student hadn't demonstrated effort, they still assumed something else was preventing them and offered help.\n\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudiced attitudes.

But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger.

OK so this is the solitary age of the 90's, + people don't want to trust anyone or anything else but the greater reason is the abysmal public transport we have at this time. Over priced, shoddy surroundings, poor service and more often than not, late. If public transport was just a little bit more accomadating than it is then many people would consider using it rather than their own private 'tank'.\nA root cause for these problems is the endless privatisation of anything and everything by this government. They feed endless diatribes onto the people who are too lethargic to care. They say that privatisation will lead to better service and prices. However the advent of many, separate profit making companies running the roads and track cant be good for the consumer in the long term. The government is effectively handing out monopolies to companies just to try and balance their short term interests.\nAlso the means of transportation hasn't changed greatly in the past 10 years whilst the volume of traffic has increased threefold in the case of the roadsystem. Obviously more roads are needed. However there is a limit. Nobody wants a concrete jungle for a country. There is though an optimum balance which I believe has not yet been reached. It is when bypasses of bypasses are being built that the country will reach saturation levels. To be fair the authority's are in a no win situation here. If they don't build more roads then people complain about the density of traffic and if they do then rabid enviromentalists spring out form their undergrouth and start chaining themselves to trees!

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'. Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly. The M25 has already been dubbed 'the biggest car-park in Europe', and if current trends continue, the number of cars using it will double by 2030.\nA huge amount of pollution is chewed out by all those cars, contributing to global warming, acid rain and smog in cities. Although catalytic converters are now compulsory on new cars, fumes in cities have become so bad that scientists have linked them to a marked increase in the number of asthma sufferers. The emissions from diesel vehicles - cars, buses and lorries - are particularly harmful (just watch a bus start its engine, and observe the huge black cloud that belches forth from its exhaust pipe), and yet there is no control on these vehicles' exhaust.\nHundreds of people are killed on the roads every year, and as cars become faster and taffic denser, the number of accidents will surely increase. Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorries around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the road-haulage lobby on the government. Lorries create more noise and pollution than cars, and are much more damaging to the roads they travel on.\nNow that rail privatisation has gone ahead, many people are likely to lose faith in trains, due to the percieved inefficiency of the operators (for example the time-table book full of errors or the recent survey in Which? magazine about overcharging). Fares are likely to increase, and many rural lines that used to be subsidised by the government face closure.

It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to \"fill in the gaps\". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors. We are simply running out of room to build new roads.\nOne of the main side effects of road travel in particular is pollution. Acid rain, asthma and many other problems are rife and soon the fuels for these cars will be running out. Gas buses and gars is really only a short term solution and a renewable source must be found. But with petrol companies unwilling to investigate water and alcohol powered cars for fear of losing petrol sales these still seem a long way off as our everyday form of transport.\nSolutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The United Kingdom, despite its small size and population of around 55 million, is experiencing overpopulation, leading to an overburdened public transport system. This situation has forced an increasing number of people to rely on cars, making Britain the country with the highest number of cars per mile of road globally. Current traffic policies are unable to address these issues, necessitating a more radical and unpopular approach.\n\nBritish rail has a reputation for being slow, late, and costly. The allure of rail travel and steam engines has diminished over time, with many old tracks being dismantled. To relieve road congestion, it is essential to promote rail travel by opening new lines and maintaining existing ones rather than closing them. Although privatization of British Rail may lead to a more competitive service, it risks closing smaller, less profitable lines and improving only main route services. The reliability of British rail remains questionable compared to other countries, even developing ones, and efforts to make fares more affordable and appealing to families are lacking.\n\nUntil the rail service improves, people will continue to use increasingly clogged roads. Building new roads or widening existing ones does not solve the problem, as more cars simply fill the gaps. For example, the Newbury bypass construction has recently been halted for three days due to protests. Additionally, road travel contributes significantly to pollution, causing issues such as acid rain and asthma. Gas buses and gasoline engines are temporary fixes, and a sustainable solution is needed. However, petrol companies have been slow to invest in water or alcohol-powered cars due to concerns over losing petrol sales.\n\nIn conclusion, Britain's solutions to its transport and environmental challenges have been largely inadequate and unsuccessful. A more innovative approach is needed to address the growing congestion and pollution resulting from an overreliance on cars. Promoting a reliable and efficient rail network could be a crucial step toward alleviating these problems.", "speed": 0.36272113875156453, "eta": "00h05m55s"}

The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety. Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There are numerous problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK, with the most prominent issues concerning road transport being congestion and safety.

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six.

This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish, and can travel \"door-to-door\" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years, due to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.\nI think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport. The government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements, such as the widening of motorways. This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport, with more services on the timetables, lower rates and less delays. These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The rate of car ownership continues to increase rapidly, leading to potential complete road congestion and significant issues for the UK's transport system. Multiple factors contribute to this trend, primarily driven by people's desire for increased freedom and disposable income, which invariably boosts car ownership. Safety concerns also play a role, with many individuals opting to use cars over walking or public transportation due to perceived threats to personal and familial security. High-profile cases such as the James Bulger and Fred and Mary West incidents exacerbate these fears, causing people to prioritize their safety.\n\nMoreover, the convenience of cars, offering flexibility in travel schedules and door-to-door service, further discourages the use of public transportation. As a result, cycling has also become less appealing due to safety concerns and pollution levels. Simultaneously, rail travel's popularity has declined, partly due to its perceived unreliability and the lack of freedom compared to cars.\n\nGiven these challenges, I believe the government should actively work to reduce car usage by incentivizing the use of buses, trains, and other public transport options. Increased investment in public transportation infrastructure, rather than merely road expansions like motorway widening, could make public transport more attractive and efficient.

There has not be whole sale reform of the electral system within Britain since women were granted the vote in the 1920's. This only alowed a growth in the electorate with the system of voting not having changed since the last century. This above all else can be seen to make Britain an undemocratic country.\nThe system used within Britain is known as the \"First past the post\" system. This is the system of direct constituencies. within these constiuencies the candidate with the largest number of votes is elected. This means that in many areas candidates are elected with under 50% of the total vote within that constituency. These successful candidate move on to the House of Commons to become MPs. This creates a house of representatives voted in by a minority vote in many cases (the only exceptions being for instance Huntington or Islington two very safe seats). This led the times when at a general election when parties have come to power with less votes than the main opposition party. This was the case in 1970 with the Conservative victory under Edward Heath. Many would argue that the weaknesses and unfairness of this system are apparent and that it should be changed. However there are strengths to this system. The first past the post system always leads to strong government usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the conservatives in the early 1960's was done through the first past the post system; The other option is proportional representation which is seen to give more say to the electorate on who get elected. But unfortunatly this system can lead to weak government allowing the growth of political extremist parties, through the ability to have a member of Parliament even with the overall vote. Also weak government, especially within Britains 3 party system where the balance of power would always be held by the Liberal Democrats and the National Parties. <|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Despite being often cited as having the oldest democracy in the world, the British electoral system can seem antiquated, old-fashioned, and unfair in many ways. Since the suffrage expansion in the 1920s, Britain has not undergone a wholesale reform of its electoral system, leaving the voting process largely unchanged since the last century. This makes Britain appear undemocratic to some observers.\n\nThe \"First past the post\" system, used within Britain, operates as a system of direct constituencies where the candidate with the most votes wins. This method often results in elected candidates receiving less than 50% of the total vote in their constituencies. Consequently, representatives elected to the House of Commons frequently come from minority support in their constituencies, with the exception of very safe seats, such as Huntington or Islington. In some cases, a party has won a general election with fewer total votes than the main opposition party, such as the Conservative victory under Edward Heath in 1970. Critics argue that the weaknesses and perceived unfairness of this system are evident and should be addressed.\n\nHowever, proponents of the \"First past the post\" system emphasize its strengths, namely the creation of strong governments, as it typically results in a workable majority for the governing party. During the early 1960s, much of Britain's progress into the modern economic world was made possible through this system. An alternative to this system is proportional representation, which advocates argue gives voters more influence in the election outcome. Nonetheless, proportional representation can lead to weak governments, potentially fostering political extremism. This system also risks perpetuating a political landscape where power consistently resides with the Liberal Democrats and national parties, due to Britain's three-party system.", "speed": 0.38200327027316094, "eta": "00h04m13s"}

It is, however, in my opinion, the best way for the basis of government. Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.\nIt is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls at the first hurdle. With this system any madman can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.\nThere is no fair and perfect way to run a country.

However, this is problematic since 3,000 voters did not want X in power, forming a clear minority. Furthermore, the notion that each constituency should have an MP who advocates for its beliefs in parliament has significant flaws. For instance, when an MP changes parties, it undermines the trust of constituents who believed they were voting for specific ideas, not the current actions of the party.\n\nUnder the current system, once a party comes into power, it is at liberty to change policies at will. This often leads to hollow promises made at election time to secure future votes, with no real accountability for the promises made.\n\nThe British parliamentary system, while imperfect, fares better than dictatorships by preventing any single individual from controlling a country, which could lead to economic disasters not only domestically but also for related countries.\n\nNo electoral system is entirely fair and perfect.

This was essential for our survival. In the modern world there is no need to hunt in order to obtain our food.\nThis raises the moral issue, 'is it right and just to kill animals if we aren't going to eat them'? Are blood sports acceptable in todays society?\nThen again, should foxhunting be classed as a sport. The fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers as it is a carniverous predator and will eat the farmers smaller livestock. Therefore foxhunting has the purpose of a modern day 'pest control company' whose role is to exterminate rodents and pests. There are however organised leisure fox hunts for fun and I am sure that the participants enjoy themselves immensely. No doubt most of the fun is had in the chase and not the kill. Therefore perhaps like fishermen (leisure), the prey could be caught and then released. Unfortunately the hounds won't see it this way!\nThe pursuit of fox hunting comes under a lot of attack from pressure groups. Protests are all very well but the protesters have taken it too far recently. In the 1st week of the New Year a man and his wife were beaten up severely by a gang of protestors in front of their two young children. by doing this the protestors are taking the law into their own hands and whats more are violating the very laws of inhumanity which they so ardently stick up for.\nBy banning fox hunting the law would probably drive the sport 'underground' as it were and the participants would find some way around it.

This raises the moral issue: 'Is it right and just to kill animals if we aren't going to eat them?' Are blood sports acceptable in today's society?\n\nThen again, should foxhunting be considered a sport? The fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers as it is a carnivorous predator and will eat the farmers' smaller livestock. Therefore, foxhunting functions as a modern-day 'pest control company,' whose role is to exterminate rodents and pests. There are, however, organized leisure fox hunts for fun, and the participants undoubtedly enjoy themselves immensely. Most of the fun is likely in the chase and not the kill. Some might argue that like recreational fishermen, the prey could be caught and released, but the hounds won't see it this way.\n\nThe pursuit of fox hunting comes under a lot of attack from pressure groups. Protests are all well and good, but the protesters have taken it too far recently. For example, in the first week of the New Year, a man and his wife were brutally attacked by a gang of protestors in front of their two young children. By doing this, the protestors are taking the law into their own hands and violating the very laws of inhumanity which they ardently advocate.\n\nBanning fox hunting might drive the sport underground, and participants would find ways around it.

There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport. There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people hunt foxes is primarily because they view them as pests that damage their poultry and enjoy the social aspect of the sport. However, in today's world, farmers can find other solutions to protect their chickens without resorting to hunting foxes. If such methods are implemented, there would be no need for fox hunting, which often harms not only foxes but also other wildlife and sometimes innocent animals. Foxes caught during these hunts often suffer a gruesome death.\n\nMany people find no joy in watching foxes being hunted, and it is not a sport they would enjoy. Reducing the number of foxes killed could decrease the rabbit population, which would benefit farmers without causing harm to the ecosystem. Fox hunting involves chasing foxes with dogs and horses, which is distressing and unfair. Foxes have as much right to life as humans, and there are more humane ways to address the problem. Foxes don't necessarily need to be hunted to control rabbit populations, as farmers have access to other methods like poisons.

The constant pounding of the head during a match doesn't necessarily do take it's toll immediately, but as a boxer's career continues, the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high.

Should boxing be banned. My answer to all of these questions is no. Maybe boxing is brutal, but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances. Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death. If boxing were banned where would we draw the line, skiing? mountaineering? diving? darts?

Fighting is an inherent part of human nature, and people should have the freedom to engage in it in controlled environments.\n\nWhile boxing is undoubtedly brutal, restricting it is unnecessary.

Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice, and people should be allowed to decide whether or not to watch or participate in boxing.

One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health. \nAlso, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\nHowever, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing. Great precautions are taken to make boxing as safe a sport as possible, with several paramedics at ringside if they are needed.\nAlso, no-one is forcing boxers to fight. They have the decision as to whether or not they should participate in boxing match. Surely the choice should be theirs to make?<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "One of the main arguments against the continuation of boxing is the severe harm it can inflict on boxers due to the repeated impact to their heads, potentially leading to fatal or terminal injuries. Each punch that hits a boxer's head causes the brain to jerk from side to side until it stops against the inner temple wall. While a single punch might not cause serious harm, continuous blows can damage the brain severely. The brain, encased in protective fluid, gradually loses this protection, leaving it vulnerable to serious harm.\n\nPro boxers and fans argue that professional fights typically last six 3-minute rounds, during which a boxer might receive only 100 hits. They also contend that professional boxers usually fight three times a year, resulting in around 300 head hits per year. However, this perspective overlooks extensive sparring sessions that boxers undergo, where they can receive thousands of head hits, posing a significant risk to their health.\n\nMoreover, there are moral considerations. Many people view boxing as a brutal and blood-thirsty sport that should not be allowed in contemporary society. A boxer's primary goal is often to inflict enough damage on an opponent to force them out of the fight, leading to rigorous 6-hour training days to maximize their punching power.\n\nDespite tragic incidents like the death of James Murray, boxing's mortality rate remains lower than that of other sports like horse riding or motor racing. Significant safety measures are in place, with paramedics often present at ringsides. Importantly, no one is forced to participate in boxing matches. Boxers have the freedom to choose whether or not to fight, suggesting that the decision should remain theirs.", "speed": 0.38200327027316094, "eta": "00h04m13s"}

The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport.

When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it.

The reasons these discussions have occurred is because of the serious injuries which have occurred in fights such as the tragic Benn-McLellan, and Eubank-Watson, matches. In both of these clashes the result of the match has been a brain injury to one of the boxers.\nWith these injuries in mind, officials and doctors have claimed that boxing is of serious risk to health, making it both inhumane and dangerous. I actually disagree with the doctors in their opinions. In the sporting world, there will always be injuries. It is an unfortunate truth that every year people will break their spine from falling from a horse, or a motor car racer will tragically die as in the case of Ayrton Senna. Even in sports such as running there has been serious leg and knee injuries which have ruined the careers of many fine athletes.

This is a two-pronged criticism. Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The National Lottery was criticised before its introduction as 'a tax on the stupid'.

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points. Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ephasised in this essay. I believeit is a benefit to the country.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994. Since its inception, it has garnered immense popularity, drawing millions of participants each week. However, the introduction of the lottery has not been without concerns.\n\nTwo primary objections remain. The first is the financial burden it places on the working class. High society individuals, who can afford to spend \u00a310-20 weekly on the lottery, are unaffected, but many working men and women, as well as the unemployed, cannot afford such expenditure. This issue highlights the financial strain the lottery imposes on those least able to afford it.\n\nThe second concern revolves around the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery, essentially another gambling game, has odds of winning the jackpot at 1 in 14 million and ten pounds at 1 in 58. It is particularly worrisome because it is accessible to 16-year-olds, who are susceptible to the allure of instant wealth. Scratch cards, easily purchasable and enticing with the promise of immediate winnings, further exacerbate this problem.\n\nDespite these issues, the National Lottery also offers significant benefits. It has funded numerous charitable and societal projects, from life-changing medical equipment for children with brain problems to the construction of new village halls in remote areas like the Shetland islands. The lottery has also created jobs, spurred spending, and inspired many to dream of financial success.\n\nThe National Lottery, like any institution, has its merits and drawbacks. Whether it should have been introduced is a matter of personal opinion, heavily influenced by one's weighting of these pros and cons. Personally, I believe its benefits to the country outweigh the negatives.", "speed": 0.38200327027316094, "eta": "00h04m13s"}

Consequently many people who may have otherwise not gambled, become addicted to gambling.\nSecondly, gambling is indulged in by a large number of people on lower incomes, who attempt to win prizes to improve their low standard of living.

However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon.

Almost weekly there are stories of people who have gone bankrupt just trying to win. It is a mass produced, user friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes which you are encouraged to do by the government.

When the National Lottery was introduced over a year ago, there were few groups actively opposing it. The general consensus among the British people was that it was exciting, and that winning was easy, though this is largely a fantasy. However, the number of people acting cynically about the Lottery is slowly increasing. Camelot, the company managing the National Lottery, is attempting to maintain the illusion of excitement by boosting the jackpot to 40 million and introducing Instant Games. Their extensive advertising campaign, along with their association with the fabled home of King Arthur, are all aimed at attracting those who barely have enough money to live on, hoping they will waste it in search of fortune.\n\nAlmost weekly, there are stories of people going bankrupt just trying to win. The National Lottery is a mass-produced, user-friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes, which the government encourages people to participate in. It is often referred to as 'the tax for the poor' because it is generally those who have the least money who want to win the most and spend money they cannot afford. Despite its popularity, any party that removes it would likely become the most unpopular.\n\nMany groups are campaigning against the lottery, with the most prominent ones being the church and various charity groups. The churches' main argument is that the Lottery causes misery to thousands of people. Some become addicted and spend everything they own on it, while others, even those who do not have enough money to feed themselves, waste their resources on improbable odds. The church and charity groups also argue they lose crucial funds that they desperately need to help millions worldwide, as opposed to a single person receiving millions each week.\n\nWhile the National Lottery does donate a small proportion of its earnings to charity, this contribution is insufficient compared to what it would give to an international charity that saves millions of lives each year.

These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and other more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would have been donated to charity.\nAnother objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more on the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young people (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people. \nFinally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as \u00a340 million.

It can take quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).\n\tIt is possible to say that using computers do not stop us using our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After all somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.\n\tPeople claim that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping your finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\tDespite computers saving time, they do everything for you at the touch of a button, solve the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This is why it could be said we don't use our brains as much.\n\tFrom simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. In the control room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. I cannot see much brain power needed for that.\n\tComputers can communiate with each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I believe it is possible to argue that computers have made us both use and not use our brains for several reasons. Firstly, the introduction of computers has made us think more due to the numerous programs used on them. Learning to use these programs can take quite some time. Furthermore, once a program or computer is released, it quickly becomes outdated as people are constantly thinking about how to improve it. It's worth noting that computers can't replace the human brain (for now, at least).\n\nUsing computers may not stop us from utilizing our brains, as they serve as quick, efficient time-savers. For example, many people are relieved to use a word processing program rather than an old-fashioned typewriter. If you were to make a mistake writing an important letter, you would have to start over. In contrast, using a computer allows you to correct errors with a single key press.\n\nPeople often claim that computer games don't require a brain to be played. However, some games are so challenging that people consult each other around the world to figure them out. This collaboration is made possible by computers, which provide a much quicker, more efficient means of communication. Nevertheless, there are also computer games that require no brainpower, simply pressing a button. This represents a point where computers have stopped us from using our brains.\n\nDespite the fact that computers save time, they perform a variety of tasks at the touch of a button. From solving complex equations to checking spelling errors, computers handle everything from simple tasks like homework to running a nuclear power station. At Heysham's Nuclear Power Station, for instance, one man operates the control room, while computers worth millions of pounds handle the rest. It is difficult to see how much brain power is needed for this.\n\nIn conclusion, computers can communicate with each other, fly planes, build cars, and potentially even run a country in the future. But at the same time, they also reduce the need for us to use our brains as much. It seems that computers both stimulate and potentially hinder our cognitive abilities.", "speed": 0.3806932001611827, "eta": "00h02m50s"}

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies.

The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products.

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind.

Proponents of IVF argue that it is a person's right to have children and that women who might otherwise be unable to conceive deserve the opportunity to do so.\n\nThe rapid advancement of technology has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines. As a result, it is essential to establish regulations.

At twelve years old the mother could be near seventy and is this really the age to bring up a teenager?

Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed. People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants, there are many complications but many are succesful. People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.\n\tBodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Science has significantly advanced since the 19th century. Many new inventions and medical breakthroughs have been made, and now people can successfully undergo liver, heart, and lung transplants. Modern medicine also allows individuals with insufficient blood supply to receive new blood, and those lacking white cells can undergo bone marrow transplants. These procedures are carried out on living individuals. In recent times, biological operations can even be performed on unborn humans.\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a revolutionary technique where an egg is removed from a woman's body and placed in a test tube, then sperm is introduced to the tube. After a few weeks, the fertilized egg develops into a fetus. This process allows the fetus to grow and develop naturally within the woman's body, enabling the mother and baby to bond in a way similar to traditional pregnancy. IVF has been life-changing for couples struggling to conceive naturally, allowing them to experience this bonding and connection. However, I believe it raises ethical concerns, particularly when a post-menopausal woman chooses to have a baby. Nature's course suggests she is too old to have children. Such a child might end up with parents who are significantly older, which could lead to difficulties in maintaining a close, active relationship.

Many who have had the opportunity through scientific advancements are thrilled. Conversely, some governments have banned such treatments due to concerns over children's health and population impacts.

It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face.

But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound?

This technique has been of great benefit to the human race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.\n\tIt is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides. This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for any later events.\n\tToday, much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work on this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.\n\tWhere scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes.

The possibilities are endless, a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry, hot conditions of many third world countries, relieving them of their worries of starvation. Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people's resistance to them.

But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation?\n\tThere are many possibilities for the misuse of this process. One is a question of ethics and morals. Is it right to try and change motive? Is it the right of one man to play God?\n\tIt is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering.

One of the primary benefits is the ability to tailor organisms' genetic makeup to meet human needs. For instance, crops could be engineered to thrive in the harsh conditions of many developing countries, alleviating concerns of famine. Similarly, cattle could be bred to be more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass, or even genetically modified to resist diseases. In practice, some genetic manipulation already occurs, as racehorses are selectively bred, and gardeners crossbreed plants to suit their requirements.\n\nHowever, the process of genetic mutation faces considerable opposition. While the potential benefits are attractive and would likely earn a scientist considerable recognition, concerns arise regarding the unintended consequences. The misuse of genetic manipulation presents significant ethical and moral dilemmas. Is it justifiable to alter an organism's inherent nature? Who has the right to \"play God\" and make such profound changes?\n\nFurthermore, the unpredictability and potential uncontrollability of new organisms created through genetic engineering pose serious risks. While a rapidly growing plant might seem beneficial, it could disrupt ecosystems, depleting soil nutrients and hindering the growth of other plants. The theoretical responsibility of scientists in these scenarios is clear, yet the practical challenges of addressing the unknown ramifications of genetic manipulation are daunting.\n\nAdditionally, the testing processes involved in genetic manipulation are complex and fraught with risks. Already, we are close to a stage where genetic testing can reveal an individual's predisposition to certain illnesses, raising further ethical and safety concerns. These complexities underscore the profound responsibilities and challenges that come with advancing genetic manipulation technologies.", "speed": 0.42026032746805686, "eta": "00h01m18s"}

However, if the correct program is loaded into the computer, it becomes a much more efficient method of production.

This shows the need for a human perception of a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one. However, the employment of labour saving devices can be seen as being something that frees the human brain and allows it to contemplate \"higher things\". This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, and indeed it is necessary, to learn more. This is because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is being reduced by the ability to employ machinery.\nThe computer has also served to make the brain redundant, or unused, by the advent of entertainment systems. The almost universal fanaticism of the young, it is also widespread amongst the supposedly more learned adults, for games has led to less employment of the brain.

This prevents the traditional learning process and wastes time and energy that could be better applied.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the computer, while incredibly useful, still necessitates the involvement of the human brain to provide instruction and insight.

Although computers can measure events more effectively than the human brain, they serve merely as tools and remain reliant on human intervention, particularly in scientific fields such as space exploration, exemplified by instruments like the Hubble telescope.\n\nThe advent of the computer has significantly reduced the necessity for manual labor, especially in the manufacturing sector. Robotics and automation have enabled production lines to operate efficiently without the need for breaks, sick pay, or other traditional labor considerations. While this has diminished the demand for skilled, specialized occupations, it also frees up the human brain, allowing individuals to pursue \"higher things.\" This shift encourages lifelong learning and intellectual growth, as opportunities for non-skilled employment diminish due to increased reliance on machinery.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of entertainment systems powered by computers has contributed to making human brains less active. From children to supposedly more learned adults, there is a growing obsession with games, which can detract from productive brain usage. Unless individuals engage in challenging games to improve their skills, such as advancing to level five, this trend undermines traditional learning processes, squandering time and energy that could otherwise be better utilized.

Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people from eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.\nPeople eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear for their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone and boil them up to produce offal. Hey presto, instant animal feed. Never mind the fact that cows are herbivores, and knowing better than thousands of years of evolution, this practice has been widespread since the 1980's.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There are numerous reasons why people may choose not to eat beef or meat in general.

In fact, converting solar energy into meat is only about one-tenth as efficient as consuming plants directly. For instance, a field used to rear a small number of cows could be used to grow crops and feed ten times as many people. \n\nAdditionally, there are health and animal rights concerns that influence people\u2019s decisions about meat consumption. While adaptations in food technology have increased the efficiency of meat production, such as battery farming and indoor cow rearing, these advancements have not entirely eliminated the ethical considerations.\n\nHumans are naturally omnivorous, and many still find meat more flavorful than vegetables. However, there are also fears that motivate people to avoid beef. Despite being herbivores, cows are often used in industrial farming practices that raise ethical concerns. One such practice, dating back to the 1980s, involves boiling down undesirable parts like bones and gristle to make animal feed. This method overlooks the fact that cows are herbivores and ignores the potential for more sustainable and ethical farming practices.", "speed": 0.42026032746805686, "eta": "00h01m18s"}

The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is.

This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers.

In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat. The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time, this being a viral disease. It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers. The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating, e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on. However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef.\n\nAnother reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB.\n\nThese factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell.

It is only the older cattle which are able to contrat the desease, but it does mean that the cattle must be checked, and destroyed if they are found to have the desease.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There is widespread concern throughout the country over the publication of the Jakob Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease, often referred to as British beef. This issue is affecting not only the agricultural industry but also the meat industry as a whole. The disease has been linked with many deaths throughout the UK, and its publication has gradually led to a decline in British beef sales.\n\nDespite these issues, the government has made no attempt to reveal the truth. For instance, it has been found that a vegetarian who never consumed beef contracted the human form of Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease and subsequently died. This lack of transparency has led to a decline in beef purchases and sales in butcher shops.\n\nBeef has also been negatively impacted by the press, resulting in a major concern among the public. This situation mirrors the earlier salmonella outbreak in eggs, which nearly halted egg sales across the country. Although there was no concrete proof that people could contract salmonella poisoning from eggs, the bad publicity caused widespread fear. As with the salmonella incident, the industry eventually recovered, but it took some time.\n\nThe publicity surrounding Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease has made farmers more vigilant. They are now required to monitor the condition of their cattle more closely. Only older cattle can contract the disease, so it is essential to check them and remove any that are infected.", "speed": 0.42026032746805686, "eta": "00h01m18s"}
{"text_index": 384, "prompt": "<|user|>Revise the following essay to enhance readability and clarity, while keeping the original wording as intact as possible.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nPeople in the UK may be put off eating beef because of the mad cow disease scares that are going around in the news reports. Little is known about the effects this disease can have, on humans if there is any. The public are not aware if the meat they are/were eating is contaminated or not. If it is then will it affect them? It may affect them but only in the long term or it may be irradiated in the cooking process. Too little is known at this stage due to the relatively recent introduction of BSE.\nIf the market for beef drops in the UK then there could be a drastic effect on agriculture as a whole. If people stop eating beef then there will be a surplus of cows in the UK. They will have to be slaughtered and be wasted, if they cannot be sold abroad. Veal is sold abroad, so as long as the foreigners are not afraid of BSE then so can beef.\nIf people did not eat beef then it would be likely they would stop eating anything associated with beef (eg milk and therefore cheese.) all dairy product sales would decrease, farmers would go bust, products would be wasted and the farmers would be after sane subsidies. Food would have to be imported thus replacing our own state of 'autarky' and costing the government money. Farmers would have to get rid of their stock at great expense and try and farm something else which would be suited to their land and area. A beef substitute would be created.\nThe government would be forced to carry out more extensive checks on beef and especially beef from 'mad cows'. The Ministry of Agriculture would be expected to clarify once and for all whether it was safe or not and then prove it to try and get people to eat beef again before it became too late. Extensive advertisement campaigns would be used by the government to get people to eat beef, but with a women dying and the doctors saying she died of mad cow disease, it doesnot help.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "People in the UK may be hesitant to eat beef due to mad cow disease scares reported in the media. Little is known about the potential effects on humans if they consume contaminated meat. The public remains uncertain about whether the beef they consume is safe or contaminated. Even if beef is contaminated, it may not affect individuals immediately; it could take a long time or the cooking process might render it safe.\n\nIf the demand for beef in the UK decreases, there could be a significant impact on agriculture. A surplus of cows might result if people stop consuming beef, leading to the need for slaughtering and disposing of excess livestock. Unless these cows can be sold abroad, they would face waste.\n\nShould people abandon beef consumption, they might also stop consuming associated products like veal, milk, and cheese. This would negatively impact dairy sales, causing financial losses for farmers. Wasted products and the need for government subsidies could become a crisis, forcing farmers to shift to different crops that are sustainable for their land and region. During this transition, beef substitutes would need to be developed.\n\nThe government would likely implement more rigorous checks on beef, especially concerning beef from cows affected by mad cow disease. The Ministry of Agriculture would need to provide definitive proof of the safety of beef. Extensive advertisement campaigns would be necessary to encourage people to resume beef consumption. Unfortunately, such campaigns might be less effective, especially if prominent cases of mad cow disease remain in the public consciousness.", "speed": 0.07611964305777921, "eta": "00h00m13s"}
