They are all allowing themselves to be ruled by the past and, in fact, seem to be in a time-warp, not moving forward, not even seeing their futures.

This ability to shock his audience was an attribute he found very powerful and positive, in that he was thus guaranteed their attention and a reaction. Here, he has even placed a god \"on earth\" as it were, as if to prove that they are in fact no greater than us and the fact that they can produce miracles, has no bearing on their power over us and does in no way justify our servitude under them.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Oreste's birthplace was Argos, and on the death of his father, the king (who was, incidentally, murdered), he was taken away to Athens to be brought up there by a noble family.

In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is intrinsically linked with duplicity. In our quest to reconcile with the absurdity of human existence\u2014the understanding that our innate desire to uncover the truth of the world is thwarted by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by our mortality\u2014one consequence is the portrayal of a guilty nature. This reluctance to accept life's inherent absurdity often manifests through duplicity, as individuals attempt to revolt against it.\n\nIn \"La Chute,\" guilt is depicted in various forms and attributed to different characters. Clarence is one such character who embodies guilt. His prior life as a lawyer in Paris was marked by a false sense of innocence and 'oneness.' However, when he hears a scream on the bridge, it triggers a flood of memories and self-recognition. Clarence realizes his previous life was duplicitous; his reflection in the mirror seems double to him as he recognizes he failed to grasp the essential nature of being human. He conducted his 'good deeds' not out of genuine altruism, but for his personal satisfaction in controlling others. He confesses, \"His prior life was a guilty one, a duplicitous one.\" To confront this guilt, he initially seeks to demonstrate his double nature through self-indulgence and debauchery. Yet, unable to escape his guilt, he travels to Amsterdam, a city marred by Nazi atrocities, to fulfill his new role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent.' Here, he tries to exorcise his guilt by exposing it to others, thus regaining his sense of superiority and the power to judge. He fantasizes about confessing to a policeman, not out of a desire for punishment but to regain his self-esteem.\n\nTo emphasize his sense of guilt after his 'fall,' Clarence invokes legal terminology, referring to the friends he once dominated, illustrating how his duplicity created an insurmountable sense of guilt. His journey underscores the torment and self-consciousness that come with realizing the true nature of one's existence, marked by duplicity and guilt, and the desperate measures one might take to confront and potentially overcome it.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith. They seek refuge in religion, and according to Camus take a <quote>. <|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Le Mythe de Sisyphe, Camus' novel, is deeply bound with the theme that life is futile yet worth living to the fullest. At its core, the novel grapples with the absurdity of life and suicide, themes that Camus explores meticulously. He begins his essay by attempting to define the absurd, positioning it as the fundamental starting point rather than a conclusion. Camus criticizes other philosophers for failing to recognize the potential of the absurd, often using it only as a final point.\n\nAbsurdity emerges when an everyday object suddenly loses its familiar meaning. Camus argues that individuals need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity, emphasizing that people desire and require knowledge. Reflecting the Cartesian view, Camus asserts that the only certainty is 'I think, therefore I am,' highlighting the unattainability of absolute knowledge. The gap between the quest for fundamental truth and the certainty we possess remains unbridgeable.\n\nCamus describes a process leading to the formation of the 'absurd' individual. Initially, an object is detached from its daily meaning. Suddenly, during a mundane task, this meaning is stripped away, rendering the act futile. He explains this sudden awareness of time passing and the resulting self-hatred for not making more of your life. When stripped of the meaning we typically assign to life, every action becomes senseless. Camus articulates the isolation and solitude in recognizing life's absurdity, likening it to a non-functioning light.\n\nHaving realized life's absurdity, Camus notes that some individuals attempt to deny it by taking a leap of faith. They seek solace in religion, adopting a stance that Camus critiques. This essay examines these concepts, highlighting the profound insights Camus offers on the human condition.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

It is innocent as he has no past experience. He believes that people are predestined: <quote>. To Sartre there is no predestination as we control our destiny by the choices we take. Oreste also feels that he could find his past here in Argos. This is again innocent bad faith as we can not acquire an essence by assuming a social role. Furthermore he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.\nOreste therefore starts off in a position of bad faith and moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticiy with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). This transformation is symbolised by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste her brother and not Phil\u00e8be. What primarily inflences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play.

The account of Clamence's fall is not the retelling of an \"\u00e9venement\" but can be more accurately be described as \"un \u00e9tat de l'\u00e2me\", in which Clamance is embued with guilt and the desire to judge other people. Guilt is implicit in the account, due to the fact that it is focalized through the form of a confension, by Jean-Baptiste Clamance, an ex-parisienne lawyer, however it is also implicit in various subtilties throught the play, and alludes to the universal guilt of mankind. Clamance introduces himself as a \"juge-p\u00e9nitent\", these term is not clarfied until the end of the novel, and it demonstrates Clamance's tendency to judge people, his desire to feel superior to other people and to apportion guilt to those he encounters.\nClamence's former profession as a lawyer seems to back up this theme.

All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula. Our own values and emotions play a large role in this right from the start when Caligula  is thought to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla. This grief although incorrectly perceived by his courtiers, perhaps makes us feel sympathy for Caligula. When his patriciens think that the young Emperor is ill or mentally disturbed we may feel sympathy for him if we areselves do not like being unwell.\nCaligula is based on Camus' theme of the absurd, which is according to Ad\u00e8le King \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires\". From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of human existence. He murders indiscriminantly, causes famine and even kills his own lover. What man wants is to be immortal and happy, something which, with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula knows is impossible. However Caligula revolts against the absurd by trying to achieve the impossible so that <quote>. The symbol of this impossibility is the moon. Caligula thinks that if he can have the moon he will be above the gods and in charge of an empire where the impossible is king. Caligula therefore decides to be destiny - <quote>. He wants to show his people the one truth he has - that <quote>. He sets out to show them their immortality and their sadness by killing them. To a certain extent Camus manages to evoke sympathy and admiration for Caligula in that the Emperor wants to share the truth he has found about the world with his people. He wants to help them understand for their own good. He wants to make them aware of the absurd, as he is, so that they can then go on to live quantatively and intensly.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In \"Caligula,\" the narrative unfolds through the interactions among characters, all of whom are assigned a negative or positive valuation that influences our sympathy for Caligula. Caligula remains the play's sole focus, with his actions, thoughts, and words driving the story forward. This focalization ultimately allows the reader or audience to decide whether they harbor any sympathy or admiration for him, as our personal values and emotions play a significant role from the outset. For example, initially, Caligula is thought to be mourning his sister Drusilla's death, which his courtiers misinterpret, perhaps prompting us to feel sympathy for him.\n\nCaligula's character embodies Camus' theme of the absurd\u2014the irreconcilable conflict between human desires and realities. From Drusilla's death to his own demise, Caligula becomes acutely aware of human mortality and the futility of existence. He murders indiscriminately, causes famine, and even kills his lover, actions that underscore the impossibility of achieving immortality and happiness that he desires. Despite this awareness, Caligula rebels against the absurd by attempting to attain the impossible. His fixation on the moon symbolizes this desire for transcendence. In this quest, Caligula decides to be destiny, striving to reveal to his people the one truth he has discovered\u2014that while they cannot achieve immortality, they can understand the absurdity of their existence. In doing so, Caligula partially evokes sympathy and admiration for his attempt to help his people live more fully by sharing his profound understanding of the world.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

However the way the violence is carried out, the immediate aims of the violence and the victims of this violence are all different. One common denominator however is that the violence is carried out in the name of the communists.\nThe first difference I wish to make is that regarding the target of political violence. In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on the Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands to the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.\nIn 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off.

They also however interact with each other, making the arguments of the other more credible or maybe discounting other's arguments and thus swaying the audience to one side. It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him - <quote>. Shocked that it is not for his sister that he mourns but the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.\nHe announces that he wants \"la lune\" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but to other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too. We see that he is searching for something out of reach, and we have sympathy knowing that the moon is impossible. Camus explores this theme in Le Mythe de Sisyphe where he says thant man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, onnes with nature, and innocence, but instead recieves lies, disorder, and a separation of man and nature ending in death not immortality - and warns <quote>.

These reactions and interactions not only highlight the individual perspectives of the characters but also weave together a narrative that either lends credibility to or sways the audience toward one side. The play ultimately compels us to feel sympathy for Caligula, despite his brutal deeds, by examining his words and the words and actions of others, revealing the depth of his character.\n\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, Caligula's sister, dies. The audience immediately sympathizes with death and the profound effect of mourning. However, we are taken aback when we learn that the 'death' Caligula mourns is actually the revelation of a 'verit\u00e9'\u2014a shocking truth that shifts the emotional landscape of the play. Drusilla's death serves as a catalyst, prompting Caligula to delve deeper into the human condition.\n\nShocked to realize that he mourns not for his sister but for the broader state of humanity, Caligula begins to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth. This revelation captures our fascination with him. Early in the play, Caligula announces his desire for \"la lune,\" which initially seems ridiculous to the audience. However, other characters, such as H\u00e9licon, find this goal perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon's agreement to help Caligula in his quest\u2014despite the apparent impossibility\u2014begins to shift the audience's perception of him. We start to empathize with Caligula's search, knowing that the moon, like many of his desires, is ultimately beyond our grasp.\n\nCamus delves into this theme of unattainable pursuit in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe,\" stating that humanity's quest for truth, understanding, and clarity often leads to lies and disorder, resulting in a separation from nature and, ultimately, death rather than immortality. The audience, aware of the moon's unattainable nature, takes pity on Caligula.\n\nAs the play progresses, the interplay between the characters' dialogues and actions continues to build a complex narrative. They not only reflect each other's viewpoints but also mold the audience's perceptions, drawing us closer to Caligula's tragic, yet intriguing, story. Through this intricate web of interactions, Camus masterfully illustrates how the search for meaning and fulfillment is filled with paradoxes and ironies that both confound and captivate us.

If this is the case then all actions are equal, as nothing really matters. <quote>.\nMan is born free, according to Camus and he has the choice to be however he chooses and can change this way of living whenever he wishes. Camus was an athiest so he did not believe in any metaphysical power or fate which dictated how you should act. \nMan is always in search of knowledge & truth. He wants to be one with the world and understand it fully. This is not possible because, to understand something completely, you have to be fused with it, otherwise there will always have to be a leap of the mind. In scientific theory there is always a gap between experiments and their conclusion otherwise all theories would be the same. The only truth that we can be sure of is that we are mortal and will one day die. The awareness of the absurd may lead us to think that suicide would be a natural consequence of seeing the futility of life, but Camus doesn't believe that at all. He believes that as man is constantly in search of truth and that death is the only truth we can be sure of, then we must continue to live to persevere with this truth, <quote>.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In \"le Mythe de Sisyphe,\" Camus strives to elucidate the concept of the absurd, ultimately contending that life retains intrinsic value despite its inherent futility. The absurd arises from the realization that humans are mortal, and any actions undertaken are ultimately futile in the face of inevitable death. Camus posits that this recognition does not equate to the worthlessness of all actions; instead, it highlights the equality of life's pursuits in their ultimate insignificance.\n\nCamus, an atheist, argued that humans are born free and possess the agency to choose their path, refusing to succumb to metaphysical constraints or predetermined fates. This belief underscores his conviction that individuals can always alter their way of life. Humanity's relentless quest for knowledge and truth exemplifies an inherent desire to understand and connect with the world. However, this pursuit inevitably encounters a gap, as absolute comprehension necessitates an unfeasible fusion with the subject, resulting in a perpetual intellectual leap.\n\nDespite acknowledging the absurd, Camus firmly asserts that suicide is not a natural consequence of life's futility. He believes that, as humans persist in their search for truth, they must confront the only certainty of existence: mortality. This confrontation compels individuals to continue living, persevering in their quest for truth amidst the absurdity. Camus emphasizes that the awareness of death should not drive one toward self-destruction but rather inspire a continued pursuit of meaning within the confines of human existence. <quote>.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education.

Although any French citizen with the baccaleaur\u00e9at is entitled through the constitution to a university education, the system is still characterised by major inequalities.\nThe system of non-selection for all univerisity courses (with a few exceptions such as dentistry and medecine had led to the impoverishment of the quality of instruction and the status of the universities.

However, the drop out rate is incredibly high, about 57%, so many waste a year and undergo a great deal of stress, both emotional and financial in this manner. Before the Ev\u00e8nements of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and ruled to closely from Paris. After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff.

Although any French citizen with a baccalaureat is constitutionally entitled to a university education, the system is still characterized by major inequalities.\n\nThe system of non-selection for all university courses, with only a few exceptions such as dentistry and medicine, has led to the impoverishment of instruction quality and the status of universities. In an effort to appear democratic, the system allows anyone with a baccalaureat to enter the first year of a university course. However, the dropout rate is incredibly high, around 57%, causing many to waste a year and endure significant emotional and financial stress.\n\nBefore the events of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and heavily controlled from Paris. Following 1968, Edgar Faure attempted to introduce more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. While the Ministry remained responsible for building costs, universities were given more freedom to choose academic staff and were divided into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER). However, these divisions often reflected the political leanings of their professors, leading to stagnation from political squabbles.\n\nAs a result, the prestige of a university graduate in France is lower compared to their European counterparts. Universities have limited contact with the business world, and the divided nature of the UERs inhibits interdisciplinary collaboration. A university license does not necessarily guarantee a good job, and a \"jeune diplom\u00e9\" might end up working in a supermarket.\n\nTherefore, many students question whether the strain of the French university is worth it when it does not guarantee future opportunities. When it comes to top jobs, graduates of \"Grandes Ecoles,\" described by \"The Guardian\" as \"The Cream of the Crop,\" are given top priority. These schools train an elite for future top careers in administration, industry, and government. Two-thirds of the top hundred French firms have directors who are graduates of these schools, guaranteeing high-ranking careers and accelerated promotions.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism. The CFDT (Conf\u00e9deration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail), has a more reformist stance, and the FO (Force Ouvri\u00e8re) has a more co-operation nature.\nPerhaps due to the ideological extremism of the CGT, perhaps through fear of losing jobs, or of opposing a very authoritative patronat, union membership in France has always been weak, representing at the present time only 15% of the workforce.

In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to reflect the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.\nWhen the socialists came to power in 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the \"code du travail\" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1/3 of this \"Code du Travail\" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, and before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.\nTrade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had to wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given a legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes. \nThe main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership of the PCF is  a large aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conf\u00e9deration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail-force ouvri\u00e8re) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become too radical for many of its Catholic members. The CFDT is connected with the PS (Partie Socialiste) although it is the least eager to appear as acting as a back-up for politics.\nBesides these 3 groups there are many other Trade Union formations in France - their large number meaning weakness and low membership.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "All industrial relations are rooted in socialist groupings.

The number of French employees unionized is relatively small (about 11%) and thus there is great competition between individual trade unions for membership, and a great distinction between the individual characteristics.\nDuring an economic expansion, as was experienced by France in the period 1945-75, unions can make demands for their workers for better pay and working conditions. But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.\nMembership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions has always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, those members who were left tended to be those who identified with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.\nBefore 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's demands, and this did not help the falling membership numbers.\nEmployers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation. This was because the great majority of firms in France were small family concerns which had sprung up in the 19th century - the PME (petites et moyennes entreprises). The boss was seen as a patriarch who should not be challenged.\nThe period of industrial relations in France under the 5th Republic can be divided into three periods. The first is 1958 to 1968. During this time the State was highly interventionist in its approach to the economy, regulating pay and price levels and investing in and developping the economy.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly.

France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life.

Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential.

While some articles suggest it is the Prime Minister, past Presidents and Prime Ministers have claimed it is the President. Some even argued for a twin-headed executive, but historically, Prime Ministers have accepted Presidential supremacy.\n\nThe constitution states that the Prime Minister is generally in charge of the government and has the authority to appoint ministers, among other functions. However, this function has been increasingly usurped by the President, along with other roles.\n\nWhen asked about the Prime Minister's role, Giscard d'Estaing stated that the Prime Minister was responsible for contingency problems, while the President managed what was permanent and essential.

Thus, the role of the Prime Minister remains a controversial issue.\n\nThe President's role, defined in the Constitution, is also ambiguous and controversial. Article 5 claims that the President is an \"arbiter.\" This term is sufficiently vague to be interpreted differently. De Gaulle claimed that it empowered him to rule the nation, and his successors have interpreted it as a call for an interventionist approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the 5th Republic's constitution sought to balance power between the President and Prime Minister, ambiguities and historical practices have led to tensions and differing interpretations, particularly regarding the roles and powers of these key positions.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "After the debacle of the Fourth Republic, characterized by governmental and ministerial instability, which resulted in a series of ineffective coalition governments, there was a pressing need in France for a strong central government. The situation reached a critical point in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. In 1946, De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in a famous speech at Bayeux. However, he had retreated from the political forefront of the Fourth Republic, frustrated by the lack of recognition from the French and their victorious allies who disliked his authoritarian leadership style and negotiation methods.

The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, ensuring that the powers of the executive did not stem from the executive. This clarity in governance structure reassured the public about the distribution of power. Indeed, De Gaulle's actions soon demonstrated who was truly in control.\n\nThere are several points of contention regarding the definition of the President's functions. Firstly, Article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency, but does not specify clear criteria for what constitutes such an emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle exercised these special powers, citing Algeria as the cause of the emergency. This declaration, however, was strenuously debated at the time, with many believing that De Gaulle was abusing these special powers.

This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power.

Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century have been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, and the consequent ageing of the population.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have been in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, because it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't afford large families.\nThe consequence of these factors was that by the end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, as people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.\nAt the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number of old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and old people. This, and the need to build the economy, led to the influx of immigrant workers into France, with has in turn led to many of today's problems with immigrants.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Demography is the study of population and its impact on a country's society and economy.

Consequently, the number of elderly people was steadily increasing. After the war, there were fewer adults available to care for, produce goods for, and support an increasing number of children and elderly individuals.

The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair. The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Voltaire tackles the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide' by presenting it as a flawed and often devastating belief system.

For instance, when Candide is forced to join the Bulgarian army, he endures severe punishment yet remains steadfast in his optimism, believing it to be for his own good. Later, he uses his training as a soldier to kill two men and his sweetheart's brother, actions he justifies through his unwavering belief in optimism.\n\nVoltaire further demonstrates his disdain for philosophical optimism when Candide, Pangloss, and a sailor find themselves stranded at sea after a storm caused by an earthquake. As they witness widespread starvation and death, Candide's horror is palpable. Even when asked for an explanation by Pangloss, the philosopher's response\u2014that some good will come of it\u2014does nothing to alleviate the grim reality they face. This event starkly contrasts Candide's idealism, revealing the stark disparity between belief and reality.\n\nCandide's journey doesn't end there; he soon arrives in South America, only to be forced to abandon his beloved Cun\u00e9gonde with the local Commissioner of the province. The absurdity of this situation, given Candide's prior killing of Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers, further underscores the futility of his unwavering optimism.\n\nThroughout 'Candide', Voltaire gradually exposes the flaws in philosophical optimism. The constant assertion that good can emerge from bad situations is not inspiring but rather leads to a continuous cascade of misfortunes. Through Candide's experiences and evolving skepticism, Voltaire effectively illustrates that philosophical optimism is not only misguided but ultimately a philosophy of despair, incapable of accounting for the myriad hardships and tragedies that people face.", "speed": 0.3831703098585626, "eta": "00h16m44s"}

The idea of divine providence in a world of human cruelty and natural disasters was ridiculous to him, and he tries to hammer the realities home to his reader.\n\tThe natural environment which should be the easiest for God to control, is mercilessly hard on people. To this end, Voltaire has the protagonist Candide travelling all over the world and witnessing them. The best example is the Lisbon earthquake which claimed thousands of lives so needlessly. The sea is also hostile, claiming the 'life' of Martin during their journey to Portugal. While trekking across the desert from El Dorado the better part of his herd of sheep die of dehydration or quicksand.\n\tCivilization too, is oppressive and destructive. Pangloss was chained to a Turkish galley for the most trivial of reasons, women such as Cungegonde are treated as merchandise, and wars result in mass, pointless genocide (as for example seen in the overly pruriant description of the Bulgarian army atrocities in Westphalia).\n\tIndividual human nature is a variety of negative traits. Cunegonde's Brother is arrogant and patronizing, the sailor on board Candides ship is ungrateful and grossly insensitive to human suffering, the police are corruptible and have double standards and many more. In fact each individual usually has at least one unpleasant side to his/her personality.\n\tThe purpose of nature, civilization and personality being portrayed in such an overly bad light is to show how there is hardly anything 'qui va pour le mieux dans le monde' let alone thinking that everything does.\n\tThere is hardly any evidence of good will or the benign influence of God throughout the entire book (excepting Martin and the seemingly miraculous escapes which certain characters make from the clutches of death). All the elements contrive in a perverse and malignant way to inflict as much suffering and unhappiness as possible. Certain individuals have been so 'unlucky' that it becomes comic. Pangloss is hanged, dissected alive, flogged and chained to a Turkish galley. There is even one-upmanship in hard luck stories with every person having a claim to being the 'least fortunate person in the world'. All this is to show in as blindingly obvious way as possible that the very notion of optimism is totally absurde.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Philosophical optimism, Voltaire's target in his critique of social attitudes of his time, is rendered absurd by the harsh realities he presents to his readers. Voltaire illustrates the cruelty of the world, emphasizing the natural environment's indifference to human suffering. He highlights this through the protagonist Candide's journey, where Candide encounters tragedies like the Lisbon earthquake that claimed thousands of lives needlessly, and the sea's hostility, as seen when Martin's life is claimed during their voyage to Portugal. Their trek across the desert further emphasizes nature's harshness, as many of Candide's sheep succumb to dehydration or quicksand.\n\nVoltaire's portrayal of civilization as oppressive and destructive further undermines the optimistic view. Pangloss's imprisonment in a Turkish galley for trivial reasons, the commodification of women like Cungegonde, and the genocidal wars exemplified by the brutal depiction of Bulgarian army atrocities in Westphalia underscore the destructive nature of human society.\n\nIndividual human nature is depicted through a myriad of negative traits. Cunegonde's brother's arrogance and patronizing demeanor, the sailor's insensitivity, and the corruptibility of the police with their double standards further illustrate humanity's flaws. Each individual, in fact, often exhibits at least one unpleasant side.\n\nThe consistent portrayal of nature, civilization, and personality in such a negative light serves to demonstrate Voltaire's point: there is hardly anything \"qui va pour le mieux dans le monde,\" and even less reason to believe that everything is for the best. Throughout Candide, there is scant evidence of good will or divine benevolence. The relentless suffering and misery inflicted upon individuals, often presented in a comic light, underscore the absurdity of optimism. Pangloss's string of misfortunes\u2014being hanged, dissected alive, flogged, and chained to a Turkish galley\u2014further emphasize the ludicrous notion that everything turns out for the best.\n\nIn sum, Voltaire uses Candide's journey and the surrounding hardships to dismantle the concept of philosophical optimism, delivering a scathing critique of the belief in a just and benevolent world governed by divine providence.", "speed": 0.37803454468407344, "eta": "00h15m33s"}

The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to the earthquake itself.\n\tIn 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it.

It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he was alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it was only when man discovered the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus found the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.\n\tRousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads to the development of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.\n\tThis is the development of man into society from a stage of equality into a life of human inequality.\n\tRousseau looks at 'man-made-man' and sees how he is dehumanised when compared with earlier man.\n\tThe social development which occurred when men desired self-improvement led to man being capable of advancement due to science and scientific knowledge but as  Rousseau said, 'these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes'.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In the \"Discours sur l'origine de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9,\" Rousseau depicts how the development of civilization has corrupted man's natural happiness and freedom through the creation of artificial inequalities of power, wealth, and social privilege.

Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurances, whether good or bad, is that 'all is for the best in the best of all worlds' it does not matter how much human misery and violence he is exposed to he still quotes his philosophy. \n\tVoltaire demonstrates the futility of this attitude in a very amusing, fast flowing way, Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\tVoltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences are good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss.

Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurrences, whether good or bad, is that \"all is for the best in the best of all worlds.\" Despite being exposed to human misery and violence, Pangloss consistently quotes his philosophy. Voltaire demonstrates the futility of this attitude through Pangloss, whose character serves as a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it apart piece by piece, Voltaire builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\nVoltaire creates a series of great human sufferings brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all, Pangloss starts his philosophizing that these incidents are good and for the best. The incongruity of this perspective becomes particularly striking. For example, when Jacques drowns, Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically so that Jacques might die in Lisbon harbor. Another example occurs earlier in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars, meets an old 'tramp' on the road\u2014only to realize it is his old master and teacher, Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westphalia have been destroyed and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette.

He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cun\u00e9gonde again.

It is a doctrine of resignation ie one is supposed to sit back and accept everything that happens. This is illustrated by the character of 'Pangloss', who is whipped, hung, and nearly burnt alive at an 'auto-da-f\u00e9', yet still believes in the theory of optimism.\n\n\tAs Candide starts out with a na\u00efve and perhaps cheerful look on life, he soon discovers man's evil nature and the atrocities that man inflicts on himself. Senseless wars where no-body wins yet people are tortured; natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Lisbon; greed; selfishness; deceit; all are events and characteristics which Candide encounters in his search for ideal happiness. It is not long before he starts to question how the slaughter and death of so many people can possibly be for the best.\n\n\tVoltaire not only attacks the theory of optimism in his novel, but also attacks the religious order with which it is associated : the Catholics.

This notion is embodied by the character Pangloss, who, despite enduring whipping, hanging, and near immolation at an 'auto-da-f\u00e9,' steadfastly clings to his optimistic beliefs.\n\nAs Candide begins his journey with naive optimism, he gradually uncovers humanity's inherent evil nature and the atrocities humans inflict upon one another. He witnesses senseless wars where no one wins but countless sufferings, natural disasters like the earthquake in Lisbon, and the pervasive traits of greed, selfishness, and deceit. These experiences erode his belief that the widespread slaughter and death are justifiable or beneficial.\n\nVoltaire's critique extends beyond the theory of optimism to target the religious order associated with it, particularly the Catholic Church. The institution faces condemnation for its role in religious wars, and the clergy are depicted as hypocritical and manipulative, exemplified by Abb\u00e9 P\u00e9revourdin, who deceives Candide and attempts to steal his money. The Jesuits are also criticized for their efforts to dominate the subservient, reflecting the broader theme of inequality among people, including disparities in wealth, health, and housing.\n\nThis critique remains relevant today, as modern society still grapples with similar inequalities, varying by country and following Rousseau's hypothesis regarding the development of societies from their early stages.

Voltaire sought to demonstrate that human-inflicted evil was both real and universal, thus violently opposing the notion that \"whatever is, is right.\"\n\nOptimism was a philosophy developed by Leibniz, who argued that we lived in the best of all possible worlds. He explained the existence of evil by claiming that God had to include a minimum amount of evil to make a perfect world, which would not be suitable for humans. Pangloss, the character embodying this philosophy, justifies all his misfortunes by saying they were \"un ingr\u00e9dient n\u00e9cessaire\" and accepts them without question, asserting that everything is for the best and serves a divine purpose.\n\nVoltaire raises questions around these arguments, challenging the idea that God is benevolent if innocent suffer and good men die. When Candide wants to throw himself into the sea to rescue the Anabaptist, Pangloss again insists that it was meant to be so, reinforcing fatalistic attitudes. However, Voltaire rejects this notion, urging Candide to think for himself and free himself from blind optimism.\n\nAs they flee from Europe, Candide still clings to his belief in optimism, hoping to find a better world elsewhere. But his journey reveals the same vices everywhere: greed, war, violence, and religious persecution. These universal phenomena ultimately lead him to question the validity of the optimistic worldview he once embraced.", "speed": 0.37803454468407344, "eta": "00h15m33s"}

However this wit does not swamp the undertones of the serious point Voltaire makes about philisophical optimism. The book is very much the mirror image of Voltaires life as he doesn't believe in optimism. One should simply help others and live in reality within ones limited knowledge. He therefore sets out to prove these points in Candide.\n\tVoltaire's character Pangloss is the mouthpiece for philosophical optimism and what happens to him serves to denounce optimism. Pangloss believes in divine providence, what happens happens for a reason and for the good of society. It is at this point that Voltaire ridicules this idea. Pangloss contracts syphillis which when you follow it back to its origin comes from the crew of Christopher Columbus's ship when he brought chocolate back fron one of his voyages. Pangloss however claims that he doesn't mind having syphillis because otherwise people wouldn't have known what chocolate was. The reader obviously laughs at this theory of optimism and Voltaire has succeeded in proving what a stupid unethical theory it is. The fact that Pangloss remains adamant in his belief of philosophical optimism could also demonstrate Voltaire's low opinion on those who believe in it.\n\tPhilosophical optimism has the principle that all is for the best and Voltaire tackles this assumption not only through Panglosses suffering but also the suffering of innocent people who are victims. If you are stupid enough to believe in it then you deserve what fate awaits you. However the fact that innocent people are killed serves to condemn this philosophy.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Candide is a humorous tale of a young man in search of his ideal.

Voltaire advocates for helping others and living realistically within one's limited knowledge, signifying these points through Candide.\n\nVoltaire's character Pangloss serves as the mouthpiece for philosophical optimism, and his experiences ultimately denounce this belief. Pangloss holds unwavering faith in divine providence, asserting that all events occur for a reason and ultimately for the good of society. This belief is ridiculed when Pangloss contracts syphilis, which Voltaire traces back to the crew of Christopher Columbus\u2019s ship, who brought chocolate from their voyages. Pangloss insists that he doesn't mind the disease because, without it, people wouldn't know about chocolate. The reader laughs at this absurd theory, highlighting Voltaire\u2019s disdain for such an unethical belief. Pangloss\u2019s unwavering optimism further demonstrates Voltaire\u2019s low opinion of those who hold this view.\n\nVoltaire also critiques philosophical optimism by illustrating the suffering of innocent people who, despite their lack of culpability, become victims of misfortune. The innocent suffering that Pangloss endures further condemns this philosophy. Through these narrative elements, Voltaire effectively challenges the notion that all is for the best, showing that it is often those who are innocent who bear the brunt of life's harsh realities.", "speed": 0.37803454468407344, "eta": "00h15m33s"}

When he catches syphillis he says that it is a good thing, for without the import of the disease from Southern America we would not have chocolate or cochineal. The idiocy of his argument and the dry dogma he tries to enforce on others, especially Candide, serve to ridicule optimism and denounce it as having any philosophical worth. While Candide lies dying Pangloss philosophises rather than seeking help.

One of the most dominant being that of Optimism.\n\tThe idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches his philosophy at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cun\u00e9gonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721. He does this by showing the illogical traversity of it which Pangloss parrots throughout the story and jutaxposes it with a catalogue of diasters and human suffering eg/ rape, pillage war. Candide travels and search for Cun\u00e9gonde and by extension happiness is tested by every possible means. At first Candide determindly follows Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but towards the end begins to doubt it and finally rejects it after meeting the Negro slave in Surinam left lying naked at the side of the road, with an arm and a leg missing, by his master. This represents a turning point, Candide becomes his own judge and rejects the idea of philosophical optimism.

For Pangloss, every event has a purpose, exemplified when Candide's accidental kiss of Cun\u00e9gonde, caused by her dropping her handkerchief, leads him down a path of misery.

Throughout Candide's journey to find Cun\u00e9gonde and, by extension, happiness, he is continuously tested by every possible means. Initially, Candide adheres steadfastly to Pangloss's optimistic philosophy, but as the story progresses, he begins to doubt it.

It is also unprecedented in the history of Europe. The plans are to form a single economic market from the member nations, which would undoubtedly and unavoidably lead to political concessions on the part of Britain, if not total politically capitulation to Brussels. It is obvious that this would lead to a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as indeed for all the other member states, and that is to say that there would be a loss of national government power in favour of a central European institution of policy making. This would cover four main areas of British society, i) economic, ii) political, iii) defence, and iv) legal.\n\t\tAs far as economics is concerned, British independant economic policy would be undermined, primarily as being in a monetary union with other states would lead to a loss of the exchange rates as a method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain.

Many of the steps to its completion are already underway. It is also unprecedented in the history of Europe. The plans are to form a single economic market from the member nations, which would undoubtedly and unavoidably lead to political concessions on the part of Britain, if not total political capitulation to Brussels. This would lead to a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as indeed for all the other member states. This means a loss of national government power in favor of a central European institution of policymaking, covering four main areas of British society: i) economic, ii) political, iii) defense, and iv) legal.\n\nAs far as economics is concerned, British independent economic policy would be undermined. Primarily, being in a monetary union with other states would lead to a loss of the exchange rates as a method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain. The British government would no longer be able to devalue or revalue the pound to regain competitiveness with European neighbors, potentially making Britain an unproductive backwater in Europe. The Bank of England would also lose the right to print and distribute an independent currency\u2014the pound. Moreover, the British government would lose power over all monetary policy, as there would be a single European exchange rate, interest rate, and inflation rate. The supply of money would be controlled by a central European bank, which has jurisdiction over these variables. This would render Britain with only fiscal policy to control her economy, though there are even rumors that this may also be centralized in a new Europe, encompassing everything from tax policy to social security payments.\n\nAs a natural consequence of this, there would be a political loss of sovereignty, since if there is no way for British instructions to exercise their power, they may as well not exist.

Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union.

Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.\n\t\tBritain's reputation in Europe on these issues is not an enviable one.

It involves the expansion of the british market into all the other markets of Europe and vice versa. One will see the disappearance of all tariff barriers and customs and this in turn will allow for the free movement within Europe.\n\t\tBritain is very apprehensive. As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The British will find it very difficult to take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called \"the Continent\" - as though it were a separate entity).\n\t\tThe obvious advantage is the far wider market open to British industry and a bigger jobs market. \nBut one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could use their own currency without having to pay such things as import tax. But I feel the British would resent the use of ECU - taking away the pound would be taking away part of Britain's own identity. Is it why many British people are slow to educate themselves about the future plans, despite the fact it is being hailed as a great step forward ?\n\t\tWith the mergence of all the individual markets, paper-pushing will be reduced as there will be no more exchange controls with a single currency and the bureau de change will also become redundant. Staff that controlled customs would have to be merged into the intercontinental customs control and staffing would have to be cut down.\n\t\tAnother negative move is the plans discussed for legislation. Suggestions have been put forward for the adoption of the present system to one central legislative power for Europe as a whole. This idea does not seem acceptable to the British public. I feel if each country held onto its own system of legislation then they would also hold on to their own good feeling of identity, which would be lost under a central power.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Everyone eagerly awaits the introduction of the single market for the European Economic Community in 1992, which involves the expansion of the British market into all other European markets, and vice versa.

As an island, Britain's sense of national pride and its reluctance to be formally connected to the Continent are evident. The British populace finds it challenging to accept orders from a governing power on the continent, given that it is still referred to as \"the Continent,\" implying a distinct entity separate from Britain.\n\nOne significant advantage of the single market is the vastly expanded market available to British industry and the potential growth in job opportunities. However, there are concerns about the impact on firms that previously depended on importing goods for Britain. The introduction of the European Currency Unit (ECU), a planned single currency within Europe, will change this dynamic. Firms buying components from abroad could use the ECU to make purchases easily, avoiding import taxes. Despite this, many British people feel apprehensive about the adoption of the ECU, fearing it would mean relinquishing part of Britain's identity.\n\nWith the merger of individual markets, administrative tasks such as exchange controls and bureau de change will become obsolete, leading to a reduction in bureaucratic overhead. Customs officers will need to integrate into a single intercontinental customs control, resulting in staffing cutbacks.\n\nAnother contentious issue is the proposed legislation for a centralized European legislative body. The British public fears that this centralization would erode their national identity and self-governance. If each country retains its own legislative system, it would preserve their sense of identity, which they believe would be lost under a centralized power.", "speed": 0.37803454468407344, "eta": "00h15m33s"}

In practice, judges attempt to reconcile the two opposing laws or follow the European Community law.\n\t\tIf this did not happen then the UK would be in breach of the Treaty of Rome and would consequently be in breach of international law which would attract international responsibility.\n\t\tIncidentally, the Treaty of Rome is particular in that it is directly applicable to the UK. When it was signed no Act of Parliament had to be made to transfer it to domestic law to make it applicable to UK law.\n\t\tMembership of the single market obviously has some advantages for the UK. The single European Act of July 1987 was passed through Parliament by the Prime Minister - formerly Mrs. Thatcher - because of the single European Market provision (beneficial to trade for the UK).\n\t\t Unfortunately it also contained other clauses which were overlooked and which have now seriously affected the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\t\tBefore 1987, the council of Ministers could impose directly applicable law upon the UK which is enforceable in all UK courts, which effectively serves to erode our sovereignty, fortunately, no law could be passed without the UK's agreement as a unanimous decision in the Council was required.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Due to the European Communities Act of 1972, the United Kingdom has been subject to community law, which, as specified in the original treaty, is supreme over all other domestic law of all member states.

Historically, only Parliament had the power to create or repeal legislation, but this has changed.\n\nThis partial surrender of sovereignty means that the United Kingdom, comprising England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, is no longer a fully sovereign nation in the international sense. A full sovereignty implies complete independence and freedom from external control. Consequently, if a conflict arises between European Community law and domestic law in a UK court, the European Community law must take precedence. Judges naturally attempt to reconcile conflicting laws, although they typically follow the European Community law.\n\nIf the UK courts failed to prioritize European Community law, the UK would breach the Treaty of Rome and, by extension, international law, attracting international responsibility. Interestingly, the Treaty of Rome is directly applicable to the UK, meaning it did not require an Act of Parliament to become part of domestic law.\n\nMembership in the single market has benefits for the UK, such as enhancing trade. In 1987, the single European Act was passed through Parliament, driven by the UK Prime Minister at the time, Mrs. Thatcher. However, this Act contained clauses that were later deemed problematic, impacting the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nBefore 1987, the Council of Ministers could impose direct, applicable law on the UK, enforceable in all UK courts. This effectively eroded the UK's sovereignty, but no law could be passed without unanimous agreement from the Council.

This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal, technical and physical barriers. This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country, an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications. There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system.\n\t\tDespite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman, namely Lord Cofield, there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market, shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers, whereas Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.\n\t\tIn accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. Consequently the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national is inevitably a problem. One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties. However these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals, so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual, he cannot place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom, by an Act of Parliament. This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law, so that to a certain extent, a degree of sovereignty is retained. Yet, this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear, for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law.\n\t\tPersonally, I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation, movement, work and many other realms, there are also many disadvantages in store, including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The Single European Act, signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on 1st July, 1987, aims to create a single market by the end of 1992.

The 1972 European Communities Act and the Treaty of Rome have as their aims the eventual unification of the nation states. Hence the fact that there is no clause in the Treaty detailing how a member may leave. The treaty bound Britain to certain measures which have already curtailed our sovereignty. For example, the European Commission (an unelected body) can issue resolutions which do not even need to be incorporated into the domestic law of each member state - they are directly applicable. How has this affected our sovereignty ? Until 1986 each member had the power of veto so that no new law could be passed without full agreement. In a way this did not affect our sovereignty. The Single European Act of 1986, however, introduced majority voting. It is now possible, therefore, that the UK opposes proposed legislation but that is voted through by the other states and becomes law here without our consent. This is obviously an infringement of our sovereignty already.\n\t\tA unified Europe, though, could be expected to have a more representative legislative body, although there is no guarantee that we will not be in a minority then. Perhaps Europe will be organised on a federal system as a \"United States of Europe\", each state with limited legislative authority for its own affairs and one supreme house to co-ordinate foreign policy and the like.

On this island at the very edge of Europe however we do have a particularly low reputation for fighting change and for general xenophobia. What are we afraid of ?\n\tPerhaps the most unpopular EC policy in this country is the Common Agricultural Policy Regulations about the amount of food we are allowed to produce as a country have been portrayed on television as farmers forced to slaughter their livestock because of low quotas and large amounts of milk going off as farmers are not allowed to sell it.

Perhaps the most unpopular EC policy in this country is the Common Agricultural Policy Regulations, which dictate the amount of food we are allowed to produce as a country.

Most people see the advantages of what a single Europe has to offer. And why not ? after all it means a freer movement around Europe, access to more jobs, education, markets and so on. However when it comes to the subject of sovereignty, there are those who lift a hesitant finger. But is everyone clear on what sovereignty means ? Sovereignty is the effective control over a defined territory and people, it must be recognised by other sovereign states, but most important of all a sovereign state recognises no higher authority.\n\tTaking these prerequisites into account, there is no question about the first two , but one only has to look at what is happening to recognise a clear erosion of sovereignty on the third point. On economic matters, I could not really see what the debate was about on whether to have a central European Bank and how, as far as I am concerned the Bundesbank does a very good job of it at the moment.

This loss need not however be negative. In fact, in political, economic and defence terms I feel this  realocation of resources can and will be very positive. Whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality, I wouldn't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg.\n\tThroughout the world a wind of change is apparent, but especially so in Europe. This process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process.\n\tIt is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order. However to be fully involved, sacrifices have to be made. Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice. The           for the European Community will be the year 1992 when the internal market will be completed and trade barriers lifted and there will be common policies on social level.\n\tThis closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "After the devastations of the second World War, there has been a trend towards closer cooperation among European states at all levels.

It's intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services, capital and the workforce.\n\tThe competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods. Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance. European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market. The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced, hopefully to the highest common denominator.\n\tThe European does not serve only as a useful trade association, however, for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together. Co-operation between the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug-smuggling and terrorism. The common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources.\n\t However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur. The single European Act was designed to speed-up the decision making of certain institutions. The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co-operation and joint action in the areas of foreign, social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members. The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law, which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty. More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe.\n\tThe question is how much sovereignty is Britain prepared to lose and do the benefits of belonginging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages. A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt and in the next few years this will increase. As far as the immediate future is concerned a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The European Community, a collective of 12 sovereign European States, aims to foster closer economic and political cooperation.

One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community, made up from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community.\n\tIn 1987, the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992. This act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or not it will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain.\n\tThe lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade. This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\tBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision-making ability. The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created. It believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns, however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community was to bring in a single currency, Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality, but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange.

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.

The value of human life weighs heavily on this debate, leading to a conflict that has lasted for centuries.

This view posits that surrogate motherhood is not an ethical solution for infertile couples due to the emotional strains and connections between the surrogate mother and the other parents. \n\nMany people advocate for women's rights to make autonomous decisions about their bodies, arguing that surrogate motherhood is merely another form of reproduction. However, health services counter that surrogate motherhood satisfies a deep-seated longing in infertile couples. The author contends that these couples view surrogacy as a means to fill their childless void, disregarding the surrogate mother as a person with feelings and reducing her to a mere reproductive vessel. In many instances, the surrogate mother's emotions and well-being are overlooked as she is perceived solely as a source of reproduction. \n\nCertain infertile couples prioritize their desires over the surrogate mother's needs. Annas contends that the parents' biological and emotional longing is not substantial enough to warrant the surrogate's suffering. While some infertile mothers may perceive a biological desire to parent, their realities can be markedly different. There are many individuals whose lives remain unchanged despite infertility. Surrogate motherhood allows the genetic father to reproduce, often sidelining the adoptive mother, who may feel excluded or undervalued since she did not carry the child.

Today, scientists have composed names for such illnesses and discovered cures for many of them. It is common to simply ask a physician, \"for something,\" when sickness occurs. But what about more complex conditions in humans? Tests are constantly being performed to find the next medication that will control the ailment. Some skeptics, though, do not believe the true results these new drugs are showing and simply turn away, calling for their banishment. Such a controversial drug is the antidepressant Prozac. Despite the controversy, Prozac should continue to be prescribed in dealing with the symptoms of depression due to the positive effect it has already made in medicine and society. Further discussion will demonstrate how people have improved their symptoms and devalue the rumors brought about by this new drug.\n\nProzac was first invented to cure the symptoms of depression in people. But how does Prozac accomplish this? It treats depression by affecting one system of the brain, where a chemical called serotonin is. The drug causes the serotonin to slow in spaces between the nerve cells, making communication between the nerve cells more efficient. It also works to stop bulimia, panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other conditions. One doctor commented that Prozac has been effective. One case study involved an architect named Sam, who felt the drug made him feel \"better than well.\" He became more poised, thoughtful, and could concentrate much easier than before. Most importantly, his symptoms of depression disappeared.\n\nThe drug has also been tested and found safe by all major pharmaceutical agencies. Patients do not experience the dry mouth, constipation, and rapid heartbeat found in other antidepressants. To scientists, this drug is viewed as \"clean\" because of the specific job it does. It differs from other mood-altering drugs, such as opium and marijuana, because its effect is \"even and sustained.\" Patients do not feel the up and down effect other \"street\" drugs bring.

For instance, religious organizations like Presbyterians for Abolition of the Death Penalty and The National Interreligious Task Force are working to inform the public about the need to abolish the death penalty.

Despite these debates, I firmly believe that no matter the circumstances, there is no need for a death penalty. This is because it will not resolve our criminal problems, and it is immoral. Furthermore, it may even hinder the development of our society.\n\nIn summary, the ongoing debate surrounding the death penalty in our nation highlights the complex ethical, political, and societal issues at play. While some argue for its necessity to combat rising crime rates, others advocate for its abolition due to moral and developmental concerns.

There are 30 seconds left in the final half of the women's championship game. Tennessee has possession of the ball. Stanford calls a timeout to prepare defensive strategies. The ball comes down the court. Tennessee uses precise ball handling skills, aiming for that one final shot. Tennessee's Passion Thompson sees the opening and lines up. It's going...going... All of a sudden, the screen switches to the men's game, supposedly following the women's game. The viewers have to wait until the eleven o'clock news to find out if Passion made the final shot.\n\nThis hypothetical situation highlights an issue that is very real: the women's championship game often receives less attention than the men's game. Once again, the women's game seems to be cast in the shadow of the men's game. What happened to Title IX, the federal law guaranteeing equal sporting opportunities for male and female athletes? Although this might seem like a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the point that women athletes are still treated as second-class citizens compared to their male counterparts.\n\nI firmly believe that college women's basketball teams should not face discrimination and should receive the same respect, rights, and opportunities as men's teams, rather than continually receiving the lower rung on the totem pole. The popularity of women's basketball is on the rise. For the women's championship competition last year, it was noted that a record-breaking number of viewers tuned in. However, many agree that the game garnered so much attention because women's games are so rare on television.\n\nWhile Title IX was supposed to enforce equality in athletics for men and women at colleges and other levels of competition, improvements have largely been seen in the players themselves and an increased sense of respect that all women athletes deserve.", "speed": 0.3804066781179839, "eta": "00h12m39s"}

But even though it has been instrumental in the development\nof societies and states, people and learned through war and consequence,\nthat church and state do not mix. The founders of the Constitution\nlearned the lesson the hard way. They recognized that the union of\ngovernment and religion ultimately results in the abuses of religious\nliberties and the persecution of unpopular beliefs. With this in mind,\nthey wrote the First Amendment of the Constitution, which states that\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. When\nthe founders of the Constitution first drafted the First Amendment there\nwere no public schools. Yet they were able to create a law that has been\nused to protect the rights of American school children in all faiths. In\n1962 the Supreme Court decided that prayer in public classrooms is\nunconstitutional. This ruling ha become a subject of controversy. Donald\nW.

The founders of the Constitution learned this lesson the hard way. They recognized that the union of government and religion could lead to abuses of religious liberties and the persecution of unpopular beliefs.

In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled that prayer in public classrooms is unconstitutional, a decision that has since become a point of contention.\n\nDonald W. Shriver presents a religious argument against public school prayer. He contends that religion is primarily a personal matter and should not be introduced into public spaces. Eugene H. Methvin, on the other hand, believes that individuals should have the right to express their religious convictions in public if they choose to. Shriver's argument is considered stronger, as he supports his position with facts rather than mere opinions and avoids committing any fallacies that might weaken his argument.\n\nIn order for an argument to be considered robust, it must make an arguable claim, and all the evidence presented by the author must support that claim. Methvin\u2019s claim, unfortunately, is not clearly articulated; he merely appends a weak statement to a powerful quote, which diminishes the quote's impact. An effective argument would have followed the quote with a strong, original claim. Because Methvin\u2019s claim lacks strength, it undermines the effectiveness of the quote. Instead of just presenting an opinion, Shriver provides concrete evidence to substantiate his position, thereby crafting a compelling argument that clearly supports his claim and avoids logical fallacies. This method of argumentation highlights the importance of a well-supported claim in making a strong, persuasive argument.\n\nIn conclusion, the founders of the United States, recognizing the potential conflicts between church and state, crafted the First Amendment to protect religious freedoms.

This is entirely\nethical and in most cases necessary to continue to have many of the\nprograms and facilities that the universities offer. To accomplish this,\nmany universities add courses and provide new things such as research\nlabs and new cutting edge equipment. Many universities even try to\naccommodate the changing needs of the students by providing services\nsuch as free tutors and bigger staffs.\nBut not once before have I heard of a university trying to attract\nstudents with grass, trees, and a fountain. To be exact, about five city\nblocks of it, none the least. That's right, our very own Marquette\nUniversity is trying what in my opinion is one of the most unethical\nideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to attend to\ndifferent racial histories and so\u001ecalled physcological differences. This\ngreen space is supposed to create a more comfortable learning\nenvironment, but might just reverse this comfort when students see the\ncost of just under five blocks of grass. It's a whopping ten million\ndollars that the students, not the gesus, are going to pay. Even if they\ndivvy it up over twenty or so years, many students can't afford this\nincrease. I myself am barely scraping by. Plus this grass will cost\nlocals a matching ten million dollars just to reroute all of the\nutilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue.\nSome of the utilities effected by the common's project will be local\nbuses. If many of you noticed, about three to five routes come through\nMarquette's planned commons and that just might cause problems. The\ntransit company is estimating to lose between \"$1 million and $600,000,\"\nwhich the university is trying to offset by getting students on the U\u001e\npass system. The University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this\nsystem. I feel that this won't help, considering that a large number of\nstudents that already use the county transit and contribute to the\nprofits of the county's transit. I feel that the city might lose more mo\nney, rather than less, as Marquette thought through the U\u001epass system.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In all of the colleges and universities across the United States, administrators are working diligently to increase enrollment. This effort is entirely ethical and necessary for maintaining many of the programs and facilities that universities offer. To achieve this, colleges often add courses, provide new resources such as research labs, and invest in cutting-edge equipment. Furthermore, universities frequently adapt to the evolving needs of their students by offering services like free tutors and expanding their staff.\n\nHowever, the approach of Marquette University stands out, and not in a positive way. This institution is attempting to attract students with a vast green space that spans about five city blocks, complete with grass, trees, and a fountain. While the idea of creating a more comfortable learning environment is commendable, this substantial investment may have unforeseen consequences. The $10 million cost, which students will ultimately bear, could place an undue burden on them, particularly those struggling financially.\n\nMoreover, this green space will also impact the local community, requiring a matching $10 million to reroute the utilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue. Among the utilities affected are local bus routes, with three to five running through the planned commons. These changes could potentially cause significant disruption to the transit system, with an estimated loss of $1 million to $600,000.\n\nIn an effort to offset these losses, Marquette University is considering requiring students to purchase a pass system similar to the one used by the University of Milwaukee. However, this strategy may not be as effective as anticipated, especially since many students already rely on the county's transit system and contribute to its revenue. Consequently, the city might actually incur additional costs rather than the projected savings.\n\nUltimately, while the university's attempt to enhance student comfort and environmental quality is admirable, it is questionable whether this heavy financial burden will pay off in terms of increased enrollment and student satisfaction.", "speed": 0.3804066781179839, "eta": "00h12m39s"}

However, critics of \"abstinence-only\" argue that proponents' reasoning lacks logic and, at times, contains fallacies. They claim that by providing misinformation, \"abstinence-only\" proponents may inadvertently encourage teens to disregard their advice.

Consequently, they argue that \"abstinence-only\" advocates are using misinformation to garner support for their cause.

Additionally, a spokesperson for Teen-Aid, Inc., an abstinence-only program, states that teens are also uninformed about these prevention methods. Therefore, opponents of \"abstinence-only\" argue that since teens already lack this knowledge, they are unlikely to be swayed by its proponents.

Suicide means the end of all problems (Though those problems\nare usually solved easily.) This topic has many sides but can be\nanalyzed with two: those who advocate rational suicide and those who\noppose it. To analyze specific values and consequences, I will only\ndiscuss the opponents of suicide. There are a vast number of reasons\nagainst attempting suicide. In one way or another, people seem to\njustify them all. People often discuss how selfish a suicide can be.\nOthers discuss the grief\u001estricken family. They feel no pity for the\nperson who committed suicide either. Yet, others speak of the\ninvolvement of religion in the lives of those that attempt and commit\nsuicide. The opponents of suicide often neglect to prove their\nstatements. All the statements that people make are good statements\nthat, with some thought, can be rationalized. The opponents simply fail\nto provide the evidence for the rationalization of their arguments.\nThe authors of the first argument fail to prove it. The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish. He does not feel that there is any\nsuicide that can be considered rational because all suicide fails to\nthink about the effects of a suicide on others. He states that <*>. Mr\nRauscher hopes to convey that the only thing that people who commit\nsuicide do is think about whether they should end their own pains. Yet,\nRauscher fails to analyze his opposition. He should ask what does the\nperson attempting suicide thinking? The person may be thinking about his\nfamily and friends when he or she attempts suicide. For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous.\nMaybe Mr Rauscher does not think about what the sight of that pain and\nthe family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their\nemotions.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Many events in our lives have consequences, but there are none as drastic as suicide. Suicide means the end of all problems, which are usually solved easily. This topic has many sides, but it can be analyzed through two primary perspectives: those who advocate rational suicide and those who oppose it. To analyze specific values and consequences, I will only discuss the opponents of suicide. There are numerous reasons against attempting suicide. People often justify these reasons, but the opponents of suicide have many compelling arguments. They discuss the selfishness of suicide, the grief-stricken family left behind, and the involvement of religion in the lives of those who attempt and commit suicide. However, the opponents of suicide often fail to provide evidence for their arguments. All the statements they make are strong, and with some thought, they can be rationalized. Yet, the opponents usually neglect to prove their statements.\n\nThe argument that suicide is selfish is weak and lacks substantial evidence. However, if readers examine their own experiences with those who attempt suicide, they might find this argument more convincing. In \"The Case Against Suicide,\" William Rauscher argues that suicide is an inherently selfish act because it does not consider the effects on others. He believes that individuals who commit suicide are focused solely on ending their own suffering, ignoring the impact on their loved ones. Rauscher hopes to convey that the primary concern of those who attempt suicide is whether they should end their own pain. However, Rauscher fails to consider the thoughts and emotions of those attempting suicide, such as their thoughts about their family and friends. For instance, a person dying of lung cancer might cause significant distress to their family if they were still alive. The immense pain experienced by someone dying of cancer, and the family's helplessness in comforting the person, might not have been fully considered by Rauscher in his analysis. Thus, the emotional and psychological consequences for the family are significant and should be taken into account.", "speed": 0.3804066781179839, "eta": "00h12m39s"}

Some people, however, are impatient and seek an easier way to earn money, resorting to theft or selling illegal substances. I know several people who fit this category\u2014they prefer to achieve wealth quickly, although they don't always know the legal consequences of their actions. This attitude of trying to get rich quickly can be tempting, but the problems often arise when they resort to illegal means to obtain wealth.\n\nCrime does not pay, and this is a very true statement. Take, for example, a man who decided to get rich quickly. His family was very proud of him, unaware of the illegal nature of his actions. They only knew that he was involved in real estate and that, as a result, they now had the things they could never afford before. This situation continued for about a year until one day, they saw their father's picture on the news. Right after, they received a call informing them that their father had been arrested and was in jail. All their dreams were shattered, and the breadwinner of their family could no longer support them. They were shocked and disappointed to learn the extent of his illegal activities. The news revealed a story of a greedy businessman who exploited elderly couples, convincing them that they were investing in a good real estate project when, in reality, he was just swindling their money. This story painted a harsh picture of the man who had supported and cared for them for so long.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers. If we recognize that a work force filled with such diversity of workers will inevitably include women - of all ages - as well as man with family responsibilities, then we see the undeniable economic connection between this \"low value\" contribution of child care providers, and the economic strength of the nation. It is not difficult to conclude that child care workers are underpaid, and the issue will be difficult to resolve without  involving employers or the government in the child care industry - which may not be the ideal solution. It is tempting to conclude with the proposal that we, as a society, consciously work to raise the status of workers who care for children - but the final irony is that, until the financial status of these workers becomes more equal, they will not be judged as making a valuable \"contribution to the society they live in.\"\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The idea that equal work deserves equal pay initially appears to align with our perceived values of equality in American society.

These are the words of Karl Marx, the father of modern communism. In any society, that principle applies to the members of the society in varying degrees. If one were to break the community structure into small parts, on e would understand the concept of Marx as it applies practically. \nFor example, the family structure in any society or culture is the first to apply Marx's egalitarian goal. A mother nurtures her helpless infant. All of the members of a family will normally protect, provide and nurture its own. Absent a deviation from our general nature to propagate and extend ourselves through our offspring, the concept of egalitarianism is a natural choice for the family unit.\nSociety also has social institutions & practices in order which preserve the egalitarian concept. In Western society, for example, the primary guide is Christianity. The New Testament teaches <*>. This norm is deeply entrenched in western ideology. These beliefs extend to the individual.

First, who it to define what contribution merits what reward? If I value my own family and I make it my primary goal to raise my children to be productive and good citizens, is that not enough? Must I go instead into the streets to save the homeless man or rescue the battered woman? Should my financial rewards be less or more?\nSecond, there is the problem of freedom.

In earlier times people had the lifestyle of fending for themselves. They were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present society. Because of the differences in personalities and ambition, I feel it is vital that in today's society men and women should be financially reward for their individual efforts.\nIn a society each person has the same basic needs for survival. Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up of majority of each person's day. In order to feed your family you had to plant. In order to live you had to build. To have clothing, you had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times the harder you worked, the more food, shelter or clothing you gained. This is a very simple support of reward equaling effort.\nBringing this to a more present time, we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology, expanding knowledge, and modern times. We have many machines to held us meet our food, clothing and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part, it would appear.

In earlier times, people led lives of fending for themselves and were not afforded the many luxuries that have become commonplace in our present society. Because of the differences in personalities and ambition, I feel it is vital that in today's society, men and women should be financially rewarded for their individual efforts.\n\nIn a society, each person has the same basic needs for survival. Long ago, the quest for the fulfillment of these needs occupied the majority of each person's day. In order to feed one's family, one had to plant; in order to live, one had to build; and to have clothing, one had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times, the harder you worked, the more food, shelter, or clothing you gained. This is a simple support of reward equaling effort.\n\nIn our current society, we are reaping the benefits of advanced technology, expanding knowledge, and modern conveniences. Machines now help us meet our food, clothing, and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part. People with great technical minds are using their talents at work and paying someone else to do their labor. However, just as in earlier days, the harder you work, the greater the reward.\n\nLet's imagine a society where all men and women were treated equally, and all basic survival needs, as well as wants, were provided regardless of the effort put forth.

In the worst case scenario, the world could become divided or even destroyed because someone was not contributing their fair share.

Our culture would suffer as a result, potentially leading to laziness and stagnation among people.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is essential to provide for everyone's basic needs, rewarding individuals for their efforts is crucial for maintaining motivation, competitiveness, and societal growth. The historical context and the benefits of modern advancements highlight the importance of this balance in fostering a thriving and progressive society.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims. I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true, but now many employers are the victims. They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I agree that historically, women have encountered challenges in balancing their roles in the workplace and at home. Women have often been looked down upon if they strive for advancement, and there has been a significant pay disparity for the same job when compared to their male counterparts. Gone is the era when women were expected to stay home; today, many women work, while those who choose to stay at home do so out of preference. Much of this shift in women's roles can be attributed to the efforts of feminists. These groups have defended women's rights over the years, demonstrating to the world the capabilities of women in the workplace.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that feminists do not represent all women. Some women were content with traditional roles, while others sought more opportunities or different aspects of life. The push for feminist ideals often means that everyone must adhere to these standards, making it difficult for those who do not entirely agree. For instance, during the Iraq war, there was significant debate over women serving in combat positions. Many feminists argued for this change, believing it was fair, while others, like myself, felt it was not practical. I believe women are not as physically suited for combat roles, and I worry about the potential consequences if they are captured.\n\nFeminists have also addressed issues of workplace promotions and sexual harassment. They argue that these practices have been historically unfair to women. While it was true that women faced these challenges a few decades ago, it's important to recognize that many employers now feel threatened by the increasing role of women and sometimes view them differently.\n\nIn summary, while feminists have made significant strides in advocating for women's rights, it is essential to recognize that women's experiences and opinions are diverse. Balancing the progress made with these differing viewpoints is crucial for a more inclusive and fair approach to addressing workplace and societal challenges.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touch their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the \"I'd rather do it myself\" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, whether you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitude of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.\nNow, after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to be in the 60's, and not looking down on females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home. \nNowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and take care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent with each other).<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I have been around this continent for over 40 years, and while I support some causes championed by women, I disagree with much of it.

The current scenario, where two incomes are often necessary to run a household, provides women with the freedom to work or remain at home without facing stigmatism for choosing to work. However, it's worth noting that if both partners are employed, household responsibilities should ideally be shared, possibly supplemented by hired help to maintain the home.

It contains a common truth that is to often overlooked: in the world crime actually costs money. As we read the daily paper, listen to the evening news or speak to other people we hear stories of how crime has robbed individuals of possessions, jobs and lives.\nThe individual who commits a crime, if and when they are caught will in most cases be faced with the loss of his or her freedom. If the individual is incarcerated whether for one hour or for a lifetime money will be lost on the cost of incarceration. This money may not come from the perpetrator of the crime but it will come from the individual's family, freinds and acquantances in the form of tax dollars. As the number of criminals increases so to will the tax money needed to house these individuals. \nThe moral aspect of crime for the criminal is also something to take into account. For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse and sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom. When convicted of a crime a mere \"I'm sorry\" will not undo the loss or pain already inflicted. The criminal will have to live with his or her actions as long as they live.\nThe law abiding citizen also knows that crime does not pay. When an area of a city becomes known for a high crime rate the result is a drop in the real estate value for that area. so even though an individual can try to add value to his or her real estate possessions in these areas the effect of crime will cause a direct loss of money for the law abiding citizen.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The phrase \"I'll pay,\" though often repeated, prompts us to ponder the deeper meaning behind its common truth: crime indeed costs money. As we peruse the daily paper, tune in to the evening news, or converse with others, we frequently encounter stories of individuals robbed of possessions, jobs, and lives by their criminal acts. When the perpetrator of a crime is caught, the loss of their freedom is typically the immediate price they pay. Incarceration, regardless of duration, incurs financial costs. These costs frequently fall upon the criminal's family, friends, and acquaintances through the burden of increased tax dollars. As the number of criminals grows, so too does the tax money required to house them.\n\nThe moral ramifications of crime for the perpetrator are equally significant to consider. For the most part, facing the prospect of losing freedom elicits feelings of remorse and sorrow. This emotional impact is equally profound when the criminal contemplates the victims of their crimes. Such moments of realization can stir intense emotions rivaling, if not surpassing, the loss of one's own freedom. A simple apology\u2014\"I'm sorry\"\u2014cannot erase the pain inflicted upon the victims or the lasting burden the criminal must carry.\n\nMoreover, law-abiding citizens are well aware that crime does not pay. Areas with high crime rates often see a decline in property values. Even attempts by individuals to enhance the worth of their real estate in such areas are thwarted by the pervasive effect of crime, leading to a direct financial loss for the community. Thus, the financial implications of crime extend beyond the individual perpetrator, influencing the broader society and economy.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

However, since the original subject is <*> I will have to disagree with this statement.\n\nIf money were the root of all evil, we all would have to be evil because we all have money. Some have more than others; some have less than others. Most money is attained in honest ways: through employment, investments, inheritances, and many other lucrative means. When money is accumulated by these means, it seems incorrect to say that money is the root of all evil. If one is attaining money honestly, how can honestly be associated with evil?\n\nIt is true to say that money is the root of some evil. People have lied, cheated, betrayed, stolen, and even murdered to attain money. These actions are evil and because someone wanted money, or wanted more money than they had, they resorted to evil to attain it.\n\nOther things as well can be the root of evil: attitudes, morals (lack of), greed; there is an endless list of things that can become the root of evil. The love of money can indeed produce an attitude of dishonesty, a lack of morals, and greed.\n\nIf money was the root of all evil, then the many agencies, groups and programs that we have in America and around the world would not be able to function without the donations of money from those who are able to give. I have to agree that many times these worth-while causes are sometimes being used to satisfy an individual's greed; but I am sure that most if not all funds donated are used for the purposes intended in those agencies and programs which are reputable.\n\nIn conclusion, the root of all evil is the choice of the individual: will he choose to be morally decent, or will he choose to be evil?\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The first thing I would like to address is the fact that the phrase \"The Love of Money is the Root of All Evil\" is incorrect.

So if one wants to eat, have some where to sleep, have transportation and clothing, the almighty dollar is a must.\n\nIt's probably more correct to say that, \"Absolute power currupts absolute\". Once ones basic and comfort needs are met, what's next, power or the power to influence. This begats the will for more power and the cicle goes on. Unless the individual has a good work ethic and good sence, the power can become intoxicating to the point of it being the obsession that controls a person's life.\n\nAnything that comes easy most probably won't be as appreciated or valued as something that comes with effort.

Many people rate the quality of life and sucess by a dollar figure that they made last year. Others rate success one heir more substantive accomplishments that agree with their sense of values, of which money is not number one.

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I beg to differ: Crime does pay.

In today's changing economy, any individual holding a job must be concerned about job security. Many people are being laid off or let go because companies aren't making enough profit to pay their employees. In contrast, a criminal will always have work available. There is never a shortage of work in criminal activities, ensuring a consistent means of employment.\n\nNow, consider the workday of most working people. The average worker typically works 8 hours per day, earning about $7.50 per hour. This translates to approximately $300.00 per week before taxes and deductions. However, after deductions\u2014$69.00 for taxes and another $5.00 for medical/dental insurance\u2014the actual take-home pay drops to around $226.00 per week. On the other hand, the average criminal can work just one hour a day and earn $300.00 without worrying about medical insurance and taxes. Furthermore, the criminal is not bound by a specific schedule and can be their own boss.\n\nLastly, let's talk about retirement. Although criminals and average workers share this goal, criminals have the potential to retire much earlier if they've saved portions of their earnings. For example, if a criminal starts at age 15 and works only five hours per week until age 30, they could earn $1,170,000.00. If they invest half of this money, the interest income alone could potentially support their retirement.\n\nComparing both options, I would still argue that crime does pay.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

How do these young people acquire the funds to afford such expensive rides? They dress in Karl Kani, Pele Pele, and Guess? clothing. They wear Cartier wristwatches and expensive Nike footwear. Where do the funds come from to purchase these fashions? In many cases the answer is simple: crime. As unfortunate as it may sound, many youths are well aware of the fact that crime pays; and it pays well.\nWhat alternative does an inner-city youth have when faced with inescapable poverty?

Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs. Being that its a very sensitive, horrifying, and contraversal issue, its one of the less publically broadcast problem in society today. Suicide gets most of its attention only when its a well known public figure. Suicide used to be just an adult problem, but over the years suicide has decreased for all groups of people except young people <R>. Before 1960, there wasn't much literature about adolescent suicide, but after an epidemic of suicide clusters in the on-coming years and a steady rise in adolescent suicide, the media and researchers took notice <R>. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for the ages 15 through 24 jumped from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000 <R>. And in 1987, the age range of 15 through 19 rates were 10.3 alone <R>. Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>. In general, white males are the leading suicidal victims over any other race or gender, but adolescent suicide is still a major social problem for all races and genders, specifically black males and black and white females <*> <R>.\n\tDuring the years of this rise in adolescent suicide, there have been many works and studies done on this issue of adolescent suicide. These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening. There have also been many case studies done on individuals looking for the cause and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different way at looking at this problem and see the causes is to look at the problem theoretically.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "When one considers the most pressing issues facing young people today, such as drug abuse and crime, it might seem that these are the foremost concerns. However, arguably, the worst problem concerning young people today is adolescent suicide. Adolescent suicide is a major issue in our society that receives less attention than other significant problems, such as guns and drugs. This is partly because it is a highly sensitive, horrifying, and controversial issue, often only gaining public attention when it involves a well-known figure. Historically, suicide was considered predominantly an adult problem, but over the years, while the rates have decreased for most groups, they have remained disproportionately high among young people.\n\nBefore 1960, there wasn't much literature on adolescent suicide. However, after a period of rising suicide clusters and a steady increase in adolescent suicides, both the media and researchers began to pay more attention. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for individuals aged 15 through 24 surged from 4.9 to 12.1 per 100,000. By 1987, the suicide rates for those aged 15 through 19 had reached 10.3 per 100,000 alone. Although the number of adolescent suicides has seen significant increases in recent years, the attempts are even more staggering. The suicide attempt rates for people under 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984. While white males are the leading demographic among suicidal victims across all races and genders, adolescent suicide remains a significant social problem for all demographics, particularly black males and black and white females.\n\nDuring the years of this rise in adolescent suicide, many studies have been conducted to understand and address this issue. Researchers have examined the problem from various angles\u2014some focusing on statistical data, while others have concentrated on recognizing and preventing suicide attempts. Numerous case studies have also been undertaken to explore the causes and effects of adolescent suicide. However, another effective approach to understanding this issue involves looking at it theoretically, which can provide deeper insights into the underlying causes.\n\nIn conclusion, while drug abuse and crime are significant issues facing today's youth, the alarming rates of adolescent suicide demand urgent attention. By thoroughly studying this problem through various research angles, including theoretical approaches, society can better recognize, prevent, and ultimately address this tragic phenomenon.", "speed": 0.3767117713253367, "eta": "00h11m22s"}

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories;  accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc.  The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.  The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster.  Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.\nThe mental effect of computers is two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, etc. People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.  What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.  Granted, it is the person who \"told\" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated \"was able to do with a computer\", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict.  Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many \"variables\".\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people.  A computer's circuits don't get tired and, if programmed 100% correctly (another perhaps impossible computation), never make errors.  This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through the automation of factories, accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc. Despite the positive and negative effects on society, it is clear that the computer phenomenon is a catch-22. On one hand, the computer has made life easier in a physical sense and harder in a mental sense.\n\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, computers are everywhere\u2014from word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, making office work easier and faster. Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Almost everyone has at least one simple computer, such as a calculator. While there are countless other uses for computers, it is evident how abundant they are, even in the most technologically advanced countries.\n\nThe mental effects of computers are two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to perform that many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of needless calculations and figures. People can easily do calculus or other types of functions using a computer. However, many are unaware that computers can and do make errors. Granted, the person who inputted the instructions is usually at fault, but if they understood what they should have done or could have done with a computer, they would not have erroneous results. Mathematical models and theories are riddled with errors because there are many variables people don't understand or cannot predict, leading to frequent mistakes in the world of computers simply because humans are often ignorant of these variables.\n\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people. A computer's circuits don't get tired, and if programmed 100% correctly (which is another challenging computation), they never make errors. This perceived reliability has left many workers out of work. The effects of this are unpredictable, leading to anger, frustration, fear, and many other negative feelings that have arisen simultaneously with the rise of computer usage. This dichotomy highlights the complexity and far-reaching implications of the computer's role in modern society.", "speed": 0.40952655067326943, "eta": "00h09m09s"}

No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually, or even with a simple typewriter. Personal computers are becoming quite common, and therefore less expensive and easier to own. Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before. Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open. We now have ATM, automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do. It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers! We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently. Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results.\n\tWhile computers have brought about improvements, in my opinion, they also have \"impersonalized\" the world. Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \"fast enough\". Interraction with humans in some places is extinct. Yes, it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank, but I miss the human interraction between people. In addition, it is also very dangerous to place all of one's trust in a  machine. It is a common fact machines do fail! Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires. Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions, and therefore are incapable, in some instances to function. With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future. Some of these changes will save people's lives, such as advances in medical technology, safety, etc.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the computer has significantly changed people's lives.

Human interaction is becoming extinct in some places, even though it might be more efficient to have computers handle transactions. I miss the human interactions that computers can't replicate. Additionally, placing all one's trust in machines is risky. Machines can fail, and relying too heavily on them can lead to complacency. For example, a car with a computer that alerts the driver of an oncoming obstacle may be safer, but over-reliance on such technology can diminish human skills.

Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered. The philosopher's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust.\n\tSince it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [24 hours = day] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it. Although I don't claim to understand relativity, I've attempted to indwell the topic [like sidphantha and his rock]. The point is my notion of time has changed; And I think once humanity realizes that time-notions are human constructions and are subject to change, that then the impact of Einstien's idea will be felt. For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien's \"invention\" for intentions not worthy of the genius; namely: atomic bombs.\n\tThe significance of atomic bombs cannot be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century.

It changed the population  and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.\n\t For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease. Thanks to Dr. Salk we are a little bit more protected than we would have been before, living in a world of uncertainty.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "For centuries, millions of people were left dead or permanently maimed because of disease.

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too. Unfortunately, wars have used airplanes. Japan bombing Pearl Habor, for example, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the airplane, in my opinion, has drastically changed the lives of many people.

Overseas travel has been drastically improved as well, as it now takes significantly less time to reach distant destinations than before. Without the airplane, a trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, perhaps a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely travel. Business, entertainment, and international relations have all been impacted by this revolutionary mode of transportation.\n\nTravel times have been significantly shortened due to airplanes. For example, driving from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but flying the same distance takes approximately 3 hours. This allows people greater variety in their travel plans, enabling them to spend their vacation time at their chosen destinations, rather than struggling to reach them.\n\nThe business world has thrived because of airplanes, as significantly reduced travel times have made it easier for countries to collaborate. Additionally, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to establish business relations in any part of the world. This trend is evident in the increase in international business over recent decades.\n\nSimilarly, entertainment has grown with the invention of the airplane, facilitating the quick travel of entertainers\u2014be they musicians, actors, or athletes\u2014from one place to another. An example of this is Michael Jackson's concert in Madrid, which was made possible due to the airplane. Professional athletic teams benefit from reduced travel time, enabling them to play more games in various locations.\n\nFinally, intercontinental relations have been positively and negatively influenced by airplanes. On the positive side, important diplomatic efforts such as \"peace talks\" between nations are made more feasible, as it would take significantly longer for someone like the President to reach their destination with ground transportation. Additionally, heads of state can more easily interact with other leaders and visit foreign countries using airplanes. Unfortunately, airplanes have also been used for negative purposes, such as in wars. For instance, Japan used airplanes to bomb Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. used airplanes to drop atomic bombs on Japan. Despite these downsides, the overall impact of airplanes on intercontinental relations is undeniably positive, as they facilitate quicker and more convenient communication between nations.", "speed": 0.40952655067326943, "eta": "00h09m09s"}

As a natural antibiotic, penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections.  This \"wonder-drug\" also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally-occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured \"in vitro\" in a laboratory.  This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered.\n\tAs discoveries of new antibiotics decreased, chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine.  It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis.  Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research, more companies, and more medical chemists, and the industry increased tremendously.

At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.  AIDS victims should be accepted & given the respect that they deserve.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "One of the most important discoveries of the 20th Century was AIDS.

Society has become more conscious of its mortality, and while a cure remains a crucial goal, there is also an urgent need to accept AIDS victims and to educate the public. Magic Johnson\u2019s high-profile diagnosis brought significant attention to the epidemic, highlighting the importance of acceptance and respect for AIDS victims.

During the 1950's, America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution. The era of Populuxe instigated a `must-have' ideology in the nation and the most important `must-have' was, of course, the television.

Mother was always beautiful, father knew best,  & children had cute, silly, harmless problems. As a result of this omniscient picture, a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of. People in N.Y. watched Green Acres. Today the same trend continues. To white people, Ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery. The examples on television are blown-up &exaggerated, but people get a general idea of different lifestyles. Rather than several small, isolated cultures, the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization\n and the presence of another's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason.\n\tAnother effect of the television on people's lives is the commercialization of our lives.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.  However, this sense of reality is not so distorted, and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman.  As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality, TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people's lives is television.

Communication is readily available in cars & on the streets now.  People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down.  They can take their cellular phones on vacations & to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call.  To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\tAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone.  When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident.  This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them.  So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them.

People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down. They can take their cellular phones on vacations and to their friends' houses if they are expecting an important call. To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\nAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone. When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident. This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them. Therefore, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them. Cellular telephones are also very expensive. They are expensive to buy, install, and use. Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call, it costs a lot of money. Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone can afford to pay the bills.\n\nThe other day I called my father in his office, from Madrid. On his \"party line,\" he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles. I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with four people at once, especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car! It is truly a mark of great expansion in technology. Each year, a new amazing product astonishes me even more. I am starting to wonder when we will have robots cleaning our house and driving us around.

Many coaches in college football run the score up and the NCAA discourages it, or do they.\nThe NCAA has been accusing head coaches like Bobby Bowden, Steve Spurrier, and Tom Osborne of \"running the score up\" on weaker opponents. These coaches allow their teams to score points well into the seventies and make the weaker teams look bad. A prime example of this is the Florida, Carolina game. Carolina was getting their butts beat bad and with just fourteen seconds left on the clock before halftime, coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout so that Florida could score again. Carolina was already losing by four touchdowns. Florida did score with two seconds left. He wasn't done yet because in the fourth quarter Florida was faced with a fourth down and two situation twice and Steve went for it both times each time getting the first down. They eventually scored. The final score was Florida 63 and the Gamecocks 7. I know I made Steve Spurrier sound like a jerk, but who could blame him. Florida held the number two ranking at the beginning of the season, but was eventually knocked down to number three because Florida State was beating their opponents worse than Florida. Florida State was probably the better team, but Florida State lost a game along with it's ranking giving Florida a chance to regain the number two ranking. The following week Florida was playing a really weak team, so coach Steve Spurrier was a nice guy and started his second string quarterback so the game wouldn't be so embarrassing. Florida won by an impressive margin, thinking they would regain the number two spot, but much to their surprise, Ohio State, the number four team, slipped into the number two spot because they beat their opponent worse than Florida. Florida was clearly the better team, so why did the NCAA, who discourages running the score up, give the better ranking to a team that did just that. No one knows, but everyone, including the coaches, knows that running the score can be necessary, so why discourage it.\nI don't believe that in most cases, these coaches run the score up purposely.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "It's fourth down and just two yards to go with a 49-7 lead, will they go for it? They definitely will.

A prime example of this is the Florida-Florida State game. With Carolina trailing badly and just fourteen seconds left before halftime, Coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout to allow Florida to score again. Florida, trailing by four touchdowns, managed to score just before the second half ended. The Florida State coach, Bobby Bowden, drew a penalty that led to a field goal, keeping Florida's lead and Florida State's ranking in jeopardy. \n\nIn the fourth quarter, Florida faced two fourth down and two situations, and Coach Spurrier went for it both times, resulting in first downs. Florida scored once more, ending the game with Florida 63 and Florida State 7. While I might have portrayed Coach Spurrier in a harsh light, no one could blame him. Initially ranked second, Florida lost the number two spot to Florida State, only to regain it due to Florida State's subsequent loss. The following week, facing a much weaker Florida State team, Coach Spurrier had no choice but to start his second string quarterback to maintain his team's dignity. Florida's impressive win against Florida State gave them a moment to believe they could reclaim the number two spot, but Ohio State, the number four team, slipped into the number two spot due to a stronger performance against their opponent.\n\nSo why, if running the score up can be necessary, does the NCAA discourage it? The truth is, coaches like Spurrier likely run the score up only when they believe they are in the right position to win, but with the NCAA's emphasis on fair play, the guidelines are strict.\n\nIn my opinion, most of the time, these coaches don't deliberately run the score up, but rather adapt to the circumstances of each game to keep their teams competitive and morale high.", "speed": 0.3591605108455693, "eta": "00h08m57s"}

Over the years, the question of whether American culture should maintain distinct genre identities has risen. I have come to the conclusion that for psychological, sociological and economic reasons, the culture should maintain gender identitites, but only to a certain extent.\n\tThe stereotyped male image would have a man as being strong, courageous, self-reliant, and the backbone of the family. On the other hand, a woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children.

The successful business woman/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\tHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to provide both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of pressure on men, as they aspire to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become so preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them.

This establishment of gender identity should begin at the earliest age possible.  Masters and Johnson say children begin to recognize gender roles by age three. (548) Children should be taught that there is a core of behavior that makes them boys or girls but, there are other types of behavior that is open to change.  The message children are given now is a stereotype that has been the root of many problems they encounter later in life.  Men and women today need to understand and respect the fact that they are different.  They communicate in different styles.  This difference is what makes life exciting.  Gender roles, like relationships, must remain dynamic.  People must know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.\nTo achieve a well adjusted, gender relazed, adulthood society must ammend the method and the message we are giving our children.

Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur.  Parents allow their kids to watch these cartoons for two reasons; first, because they watched them when they were kids and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet.  It is important to note that these bad signals have an adverse effect on boys as well as girls.

At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty.

Instead of viewing the enjoyment of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allow the enjoyment of the differences to increase social well. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlining driving force of opposite sex interaction.

By law we should equally fund all sexes sports, but in reality some sports bring in more revenue than others. The classic example is the relatively male sport of football in relation to women's volleyball. At my high school I had people argue about the disproportionally funded sports.

The most common time for a child to watch a program that should be screened from them is when dad is at work and mom is in the kitchen cooking or cleaning. Children starting at age four, generally watch what looks interesting to them. Children like to watch what they call 11 Big people shows\". Those kinds of shows not only interest the children but make the children to want to experiment and do what the people on the shows do. Watching \"Big people shows\" makes the child feel older and grown up. Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch. If you spread that out in a seven day period that's about two programs a day. Let us start when a child gets home from school at\nout three o'clock. On one channel at three o'clock a soap opera is on which has sex, violence, and profanity. At four o'clock Opra talk show is on which has sex and profanity usually. At five o'clock Ricki Lake talk show is on which has sex and profanity. After her show we have the News a game show and then a nigh time soap opera. By this time it's nine o'clock and time for the child to go to bed and out of six hours there was one thirty minute game show that is fit for a child to watch. With these television programs on every day the child starts to watch his or her favorite show and once interested then wants to experiment.

America needs to redirect that money to more important things, such as helping the homeless or promoting education.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of drug legalization is the decrease in prices, which would make drugs less profitable to sell on the streets. This would in fact make it more difficult for drug pushers to sell on the streets because the reduced profitability would lower the incentive for illegal drug trade. Consequently, not as many people would be selling drugs, as they would not be able to make a lot of money off of them.\n\nAnother benefit of legalizing drugs would be a decrease in crime. When drug prices are high and hard to get, people are more likely to commit crimes to obtain them. In cities, the allure of quick money can trap many, particularly the younger generation, into the drug business. Lower drug prices would make the lucrative nature of drug trafficking less attractive, thereby reducing the crime associated with it.\n\nFurthermore, legalizing drugs would free up space in prisons for real criminals. Millions of people buy illicit drugs every day and are labeled criminals for doing so. If drugs were legalized, a significant portion of these individuals would not be considered criminals, allowing them to return to their families and communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of drug legalization extend beyond the potential decrease in drug prices and crime rates. By redirecting resources from drug enforcement to more pressing societal needs, such as aiding the homeless and promoting education, America can make significant strides in addressing its most critical challenges. Legalization can thus be a pivotal step in fostering a safer, more just society.", "speed": 0.3591605108455693, "eta": "00h08m57s"}

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter.

Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems.

Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

It is a plant, and I think it should be legalized. The most political stance to take on this situation would be to say it's a drug and it should be thought of as an illegal substance. Although, that is the most political stance we all know that most politicians who set these laws up use drugs themselves. Over the last few years I've noticed a rise in the popularity of weed. My first time ever seeing weed was when I was a little kid. I didn't know exactly what it was, but I knew that it was a really odd smelling cigarette. When I got older I found out that my mom and my dad smoked weed when they were younger.\nI always told myself that even though they did it back in the 70's it still wasn't right. I am a product of the just say no age. From way back when I was in the third grade the schools have been pounding it in my head \"Just Say No\". I never gave it any thought I figured the world was set up so that if you stayed off and away from drugs you would live a better life. As I got older I realized that this was not true. The people that I know who sell marijuana had nice clothes and drove nice cars. The Columbian suppliers make millions every year. The American government officials who see and don't see make mega bucks, and most of these officials are the same guys who keep weed illegal.\nAs I got older and found out more about this mixed up world I came to realize that in european countries you can buy weed like you buy a pack of cigarettes. At first I thought this was extremely odd. In my mind weed was a drug I had seen it as a young kid but I had never actually inspected it. I didn't really know what marijuana was. Then one day I a conversation with this Jamaican man that we called Black Mosses.

Not in this day and age. In a marriage in which the wife chooses to stay home while the husband takes care of all financial responsibilities, the wife should not be viewed as any less a person nor denied equal ownership of all possessions. The wife does make valuable contributions to the family that a price can not be put on. Another reason a stay home wife's position in the family should not be viewed as inferior to that of the working husband is because when the marriage was entered into the man should have known her plans for their future together. If he didn't like the idea of his wife not working then perhaps the marriage should not have been entered into.\nIn some marriages due to the fact that the wife does not work, she is viewed as inferior to her husband, simply because the husband is the bread winner for the family. However, that doesn't give him the right to label all the items purchased as \"his.\" I was watching a television program and this issue appeared in the script. The husband was talking to one of his children while fixing on an automobile. The child asked <*>. The husband replied <*>. The child said <*>. The father added <*>. The wife over heard this conversation and became quite upset. She had  thought that their relationship was one based on the principle of fifty, fifty. However, her husband was labeling what she considered ',their', possessions as \"his\" possessions. The husband then went on to say that he viewed the car as his because he took care of it, She then took the argument in a different direction. She said that if that was the case then by right she owned the house because she cleaned it and kept it up. He then struck back by saying that the house was also his because oddly enough he paid for it too. This is where the line should be drawn. It's impossible to have a healthy marriage if each partner puts labels of ownership on his or her possessions.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "If a husband is considerate enough to \"allow\" his wife to stay home and take care of household duties, his wife should not be viewed as any less of a person or denied equal ownership of all possessions.

Another important factor is that when the marriage was entered into, the man should have been aware of his wife's plans for their future together. If he did not agree with his wife not working, the marriage might not have been the right fit for either of them. \n\nIn some marriages, the fact that the wife does not work may lead to her being viewed as inferior due to the husband being the primary breadwinner. However, this does not grant him the right to label all the items purchased as \"his.\" This issue was recently highlighted in a television program where a husband was discussing his family's possessions during a conversation with his child. The wife, overhearing the conversation, became upset because she believed they operated on the principle of fifty-fifty. She took issue with her husband labeling the car as \"his\" because he took care of it, while he insisted that the house, which she maintained, was also \"his\" because he paid for it. \n\nThe argument over ownership highlights an unhealthy dynamic in the marriage. It is impossible to have a healthy relationship if each partner constantly labels their possessions as \"theirs\" rather than discussing shared ownership and mutual contributions. A more equitable approach would involve recognizing and valuing the contributions of both partners, whether they are financial or household-related.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Society has a double standard for women in our culture, a concept that dates back to times when women were strictly confined to the home while men were the breadwinners and heads of households.

Jefferson made this statement back when the federalist and democratic parties were being established. Jefferson believed that in order for the government to operate at the best of its ability, the representatives must act as one.

This event is the shutdown of the United States government and it will not end until government officials. decide to work together and solve the problem that started this whole ordeal.

The government year is called the fiscal year. By the end of each fiscal year the government must pass thirteen essential bills in order for the government to continue to operate. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year. This may be the most important bill because without a budget (good or bad), government employees cannot be paid. Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.\nIn many ways this division in power can be good.

The American people elect representatives to prevent such crises, and when workers are left without pay due to political strife, it becomes clear that officials are not fulfilling their duties.\n\nAs the fiscal year ends on October 1st each year, thirteen essential bills must be passed to keep the government running. Among these is the United States budget for the next fiscal year, which is crucial since without it, government employees cannot be paid. Government officials, including Congress, the president, and the president's cabinet, often delay passing these bills until the end of the fiscal year due to impending elections. This practice creates significant tension in the government around August each year.\n\nWhile a division of power can sometimes bring diverse perspectives to the table, preventing a single person from controlling the government, it also has its drawbacks.", "speed": 0.3591605108455693, "eta": "00h08m57s"}

Who should be number 1? Who should be the national champion? These are the same questions that college football has to face every year and every year these questions seem to be getting more difficult to answer. The college football polls don't seem to have the answer to these questions because there is always some debated over who should be ranked number 1 even after the bowl games. However, college football can develop a playoff system and keep their bowl games at the same time. The simple solution to solving one of college football's most complicated situations, the selection of a national championship team, is to have a playoff system in which the top teams compete for the top spot. A playoff system will generate more revenue, create more excitement for the fans because they will be able to see some of their dream match-ups, and most importantly, it will determine a true champion and a true number 1 for college football.\nIn the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship but not without some type of argument from other fans and poll writers. Before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl with the winner earning the national title, there were some poll writers and fans arguing that it should be Florida State and Miami playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State had 1 loss in their record and that was to the Miami Hurricanes. Many poll writers and fans were saying that Florida State was arguably playing the best football in the country at the end of the regular season and they believed that Florida State should have jumped Alabama in the polls from number 3 to number 2 so that they could play Miami for the national championship. Some poll writers had a good argument that Florida State could have jumped Alabama in the polls because near the end of the regular season, Alabama struggled to the Florida Gators, a team that Florida State dismantled a week earlier.

A high amount of underage drinking occurs in the high school and college environments (US Department of Health and Human Services). Allowing alcohol consumption at age eighteen would cut back on reform programs because less people would need these programs. Most candidates for reform programs are under the national drinking age (US Department of Justice 3-62).

Heinous crimes involving guns are at an all-time high.  From the use of guns, people are dying at an alarming rate, daily.  Therefore, steps for gun control must be taken.  There are some segments of society that are not taking gun control seriously, in light of these obstacles, Gun Control needs to implemented because it would mainly reduce crime, save lives and lessen the fears of innocent ones.\nIt is prevalent that guns are being misused daily.  This leads to all types of situations such as youths being able to get access to guns and commit murders, people killing others over nonsense, and several other related issues.\nThe following supports the fact that guns are being\nmisused:\t\"Toby R.

Although there are some segments of society that may not prioritize gun control, it remains essential because it would primarily reduce crime, save lives, and alleviate the fears of innocent individuals.\n\nIt is prevalent that guns are being misused daily, resulting in various troubling situations such as youths obtaining guns and committing murders, people killing others over trivial matters, and other related issues. For example, Toby R. Sincino, a 15-year-old who shot two teachers at Blackville-Hilda High School before taking his own life, represents a tragic instance of how easily young individuals can access firearms and cause significant harm. This incident, occurring at the Blackville-Hilda High School, underscores the necessity for stringent gun control measures in schools to prevent such tragedies.\n\nIncidents like these are not confined to schools alone; they can and do happen in public places as well. For instance, an armed robber escaped with an unspecified amount of money from Farmers and Merchants Bank in Branchville, South Carolina. As three bank tellers were conducting business, an armed man entered the bank with a briefcase and demanded they fill it with money (The Times and Democrat, p.1A). Such robberies, a direct consequence of inadequate gun control, underscore the critical need to regulate firearms to ensure public safety in various settings, including banks, restaurants, and gas stations.\n\nIn summary, the frequent misuse of guns necessitates immediate and comprehensive gun control measures in South Carolina.

The introduction was made necessary by the realignment of the Eastern and Western divisions of the National and American Leagues into the Eastern, Central, and Western divisions.  The realignment produces three Division winners, thus creating the need for a fourth team from each league in order to even up the playoff matches.  The wild card, this fourth team, is decided by taking the team from each league with the best record the three Division winners.  The wild card is good for baseball because it adds more teams to the playoffs, creates another race similar to a pennant race, and provides more competition.\nIn the past, there were only four teams involved in the playoffs which consisted of only two rounds.  Round one, in the old playoff system was known as the League Championship Series where the winner of the National League East played the winner of the National League West and the winner of the American League East played the winner of the American League West.

Many crimes, such as drinking and driving, are committed by minors who feel compelled to hide their behavior from parents. Since they cannot drink at home, they often seek out other places.

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In an age when government funding cuts loom on the horizon like an ominous storm cloud, many are left pondering which area of government spending will be cut next. While it seems reasonable that some areas, such as defense, might see reductions\u2014given that the United States no longer faces an immediate threat from another superpower\u2014there are areas like government support for the arts that should, if not be increased, definitely be maintained.\n\nOne might wonder, why should the arts, both the visual and performing, receive government backing? A compelling reason lies in the insights of anthropology: since the dawn of human civilization, there has been a recognized need for interpreting and depicting the world. Through such depictions, people have sought to leave an enduring legacy. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretations of ancient cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate the essence of early human thought. This classic model illustrates how we can create lasting impressions for future generations, who will look back in time and see what we deemed important.\n\nAdditionally, art serves as a powerful medium of communication, reflecting and conveying our values. Reflecting on two leaders of France, Louis XIV and Napoleon, it becomes evident that they aimed to use the decorative arts to project the glory of France worldwide. They undoubtedly sought to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns through these artistic expressions.\n\nMoreover, art facilitates everyday communication, particularly in its interaction with children. Children's drawings, for instance, minimize verbal skills and focus on conveying the fundamental idea visually. Even though they are simple, these drawings are interpretable in a precise, pictorial form, allowing for effective communication.\n\nFollowing this notion of shared experiences, the performing and visual arts have a unique way of unifying communities. Much like team sports, people involved in activities such as ballet can bond deeply as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Within such groups, camaraderie and friendships naturally emerge among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, engaging with the arts alongside others can foster similar bonds and connections, built on a shared interest and appreciation.\n\nThe arts, therefore, not only preserve our legacy but also foster communication, community, and camaraderie\u2014values that are essential for a vibrant society and should be supported accordingly.", "speed": 0.357348535903462, "eta": "00h07m30s"}

Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method that should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.\nWith all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the right to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child.

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that is constantly debated.

The central question is: Should abortion be legal? This is a crucial question that must be addressed because it involves the lives of humans.\n\nSome people believe that this issue does not apply to them, but nearly everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two primary categories that people fall into: pro-choice or pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, it is challenging to determine who possesses enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. Consequently, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what the consequences will be and how much the child will suffer.\n\nPro-choicers and pro-life advocates have presented various arguments to support their positions for or against abortion. However, upon analyzing many of these arguments, they often appear unsubstantial. For instance, some anti-abortionists argue that women who have abortions should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby, citing cases of rape where the woman has no control. While this viewpoint acknowledges special cases, it also demonstrates a tendency to ignore situations where women are unwillingly impregnated. Such views by pro-life advocates can make their entire argument appear unrealistic about the necessity of abortion.\n\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. They claim that abortion is a form of genocide, equating a society that accepts abortion with the Nazis' actions in killing the Jews. While this may sound like a strong argument initially, it is not substantial upon closer examination. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial, or cultural group, which does not equate to the practice of abortion.\n\nBy examining these arguments, one can better understand the complexity of the abortion debate and the importance of maintaining a nuanced and informed discussion.", "speed": 0.357348535903462, "eta": "00h07m30s"}

Pink is mainly associated with women. Pink is considered a feminine color. Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are usually pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.\nCommercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, \"Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman,\" the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads have white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.\nPink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed in pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are usually dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would not want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. So if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.\nCommercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girls and Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies for girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.\nAlso baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs are also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys. A specific example is the Gerber bottles and dishes.\nAs for males, baby boys especially, blue is the\nstereotypical color. Baby boys are associated with blue.

Several years ago I considered myself to be an avid reader. However lately, I feel the quality of their news has begun to go down. I remember last year when I was- interviewed by a representative of \"The State\", on the patio of the Russell House. I told them at that time that they had lost the quality of their news, and the price was just too high for what they had in their paper.\nOver the passing years, I have come to know a \"new media.\" It is no longer the media of my younger years. Then, newspapers, radio and television were successfiil without dragging up all kinds of dirt on any and every person or event that came along.\nI guess my realization of this \"right to know\" came when United States troops were sent into Grenada in the 1980's. The media's \"right to know' was unknowingly broadcasting troop movements to the enemy, endangering the fives of our young people. As a parent of one of these young people, I was appalled and infuriated. How dare they endanger lives with their \"right to know\". It happened again in Desert Storm and Bosnia. What happened to waiting for the battle to end before the cameras and lights went on? I suppose this might come under the people's 'right to know\", however, I am sure they would hope that the sons and daughters they sent to fight, would at least have a small chance of surviving the first impact before someone told the enemy where they were. Watch out, future warriors of this country. It may be your turn to step up in front of a camera when you least expect it. \nIn the early 1990's, the United States was looking for a new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders. The media took a perfectly good candidate, who probably would have made an excellent Surgeon General, and dug up as much dirt on him as possible. They found he had performed four abortions and despite the other good things this person may have done in his life, he was rejected on this reason.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "This essay began on a Friday night when \"The State\" called to solicit a newspaper subscription, which I refused.

There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Over the past few years, one question that has repeatedly surfaced in the courts is whether women should be allowed to attend the Citadel. There are many objections to this idea, but equally strong are the arguments supporting it.\n\nWhenever the question arises about why women shouldn't be admitted, two points are consistently highlighted. Firstly, it has traditionally been an all-male institution, and some believe women couldn't handle its demands. While it's true that the Citadel has historically enrolled only males, the adage that traditions are meant to be broken holds significance. Traditions were once upheld to preserve practices like slavery and gender-based domestic roles, yet as society evolves, it must also change its traditions. Over time, certain practices fade away, and new, more equitable ones emerge. Although society has progressed, there remains an imbalance in equality, and women, in particular, often face substantial disparities. Men and women are alike, with differences in strength and intelligence across individuals. A woman could perform some tasks just as competently as a man, and in some instances, she might even surpass him. It would be unjust to deny women the opportunity to attend the Citadel based solely on physical strength considerations. After all, some men might also struggle with specific challenges.\n\nIn our country, any publicly funded school cannot discriminate based on race, religion, gender, or disability. Given that the Citadel is publicly funded, it should adhere to the same non-discriminatory standards as other schools. The principle of inclusivity is paramount; if all public schools began to impose such restrictions based on ethnicity or nationality, the education system would become chaotic. More students would have to travel farther to find suitable schools, leading to increased demands on teachers, transportation, cleaning, and cooking staff.\n\nIn summary, the question of whether women should be allowed to attend the Citadel challenges outdated traditions and requires an inclusive approach that reflects the values of modern society. As public institutions, schools like the Citadel must strive to be equitable and non-discriminatory, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to pursue education and success.", "speed": 0.357348535903462, "eta": "00h07m30s"}

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The debate over whether or not Marijuana should be legalized has been around since the sixties, and people today are realizing that it is certainly an issue that won't go away.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical/literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music.

All literature should bring us closer to our surroundings.\n\nAlthough there is some violence in ethnic American literature, it should not be the sole focus, as some classics contain violence that was overlooked in the past. The themes that ethnic American literature focuses on are hope, cultural traditions, and the struggles of the characters, which is common in most works. For example, Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" is brutally violent, but underneath the surface, one notices and finds that Celie struggles to survive as a woman, a wife, and a mother, ultimately struggling to survive as an individual. Through this novel, we learn about the ways of African-American culture; we initially denounce it, then we learn to accept it, and finally we understand it. Similarly, Toni Morrison's novel \"Jazz\" takes place in the heart of Harlem, where violence is a predominant occurrence. However, the reader delves deeper to find a stimulating story about lost love, inner-city conflicts, and once again, struggles of survival. Many ethnic American writers use violence in their novels as a way to emphasize their points. One great example is Esquivel's novel \"Like Water for Chocolate,\" which is filled with magic-making and love scenes that are spectacular, thereby diminishing the violence and allowing the reader to focus on the true themes of the novel.", "speed": 0.357348535903462, "eta": "00h07m30s"}

The quest of finding out who one is is the quest that all individuals must embark before they can truly embark on any others. We all must attempt to understand the self as children of God so we can operate harmoniously with each other and so we can know our own purposes and know in what specific way each of us was meant to give back. To say writing about this topic is selfish is to show a great lack of understaning of human nature. The writers of ethnicity that have written on the subject of \"Who am I?\" have been anything but selfish. They have given a great gift to the people of their own background, as well as and maybe even a greater gift to the rest of humanity.\nThe Ethnic American Authors' addressing of the issue of self understanding is hugely important because of the adverse circumstances that all American of ethnic backgrounds are subjected to. For example, in Alice Walker's The Color Purple Celie, because she is black, is born with an inferiority complex. She is born into society that is trying to crush her and any self-respect she might have because she is black, and female. She is thought of as and treated as nothing. Therefore she naturally thinks of herself as nothing. Walker shows African Americans that they must find a self-understanding that is void of the standards that were and are imposed upon them by the white race. Because of the situation the African-Americans have been subjected to self-growth and understanding among the people may have been stunted. For Alice Walker to address this issue is anything but selfish. <|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The central quest for the ethnic protagonist is to answer \"Who Am I?\" As their center quest, the journey of discovering one's identity is a universal endeavor. All individuals must embark on this journey before they can truly begin any others. Understanding ourselves as children of God enables us to operate harmoniously with one another, knowing our purposes and the specific ways in which we were meant to contribute to society. Dismissing writing about this topic as selfish shows a profound lack of understanding of human nature. Writers who explore the theme of \"Who Am I?\" are far from selfish; they offer invaluable insights to both their own communities and humanity as a whole.\n\nThe Ethnic American Authors' focus on self-understanding holds tremendous significance due to the adverse circumstances faced by American individuals of ethnic backgrounds. In Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple,\" Celie, a black woman, is born with an inferiority complex. Born into a society that attempts to crush her self-respect because of her race and gender, she is treated and perceived as nothing. Consequently, she internalizes these beliefs, thinking of herself as worthless. Walker demonstrates that African Americans must find a self-understanding that rejects the imposed standards by the white race. Addressing these issues, Walker's work transcends selfishness, highlighting the critical need for self-growth and understanding among marginalized communities.", "speed": 0.4113811770487175, "eta": "00h05m13s"}

Many ethnic American writers show the importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native country.\nMany of the novels we have read this semester show this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. The mothers want to desperately hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters \"the Chinese way\". They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are. Where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues.

By the end of the novel all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions - the doors for transmition of culture have been opened.

On a different note, Mama Elena in Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate endeavors to transmit culture to Tita and her other daughters.

Although such a show of strength by these works' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author, it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.\n\nIn the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mother's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show.

Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature.  However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.  \nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they did not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide \"kills\" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels.

The statistics in South Carolina support Lunde's thesis.The majority of the murders in SC are committed by friends, relatives, neighbors, or someone the victim knew. The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around.

In his aggressive rage, he may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to the death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years.

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "According to Lunde, an incredible 90% of homicides involve individuals who previously knew each other. This is largely because people who are friends can easily turn to fighting and aggression, often resulting in attempts to inflict harm, though they typically do not intend to kill. However, this intent can quickly escalate, especially when firearms are involved, making it all too easy to veer off course.\n\nIt's interesting to note that people tend to become frustrated more often with loved ones than with others, a feeling that too often leads to aggression and, tragically, to homicide. This pattern is particularly evident in South Carolina, where homicide rates spike around holidays such as Christmas and the 4th of July. These are times when families gather, and the heightened emotions and close quarters can increase the likelihood of conflict and aggression.\n\nRacial prejudice was more socially acceptable 30 years ago, yet it still existed. In that era, there was less societal pressure to conceal or justify prejudicial attitudes. Today, however, people find it difficult to openly express such sentiments and must often justify their prejudices to themselves and to others. For example, a study found that students were as likely to help their peers who demonstrated effort, regardless of race. Yet, when helping a black student who had not shown effort, participants were more inclined to rationalize their decision by attributing laziness to the black student, while still assisting a white student when effort was not demonstrated. If a white student hadn't shown effort, the help would still be extended, assuming another valid reason was at play. This study highlights how people can rationalize prejudices to align with their beliefs.\n\nAfter the Kent State shootings, rumors spread that the students were dirty, oversexed, lazy, and deserved their fate. Such narratives were employed as justifications, aiming to desensitize the public to the violence.\n\nBy understanding these dynamics, we can better appreciate the complex interplay of emotions and justifications that often underlie acts of violence, whether driven by personal frustration or societal prejudices.", "speed": 0.4113811770487175, "eta": "00h05m13s"}

The statistics from SC do support the thesis, but not at the 90%, it is closer to about 75-80%. It is still a fact that if we kill someone it will most likely by someone we know simply because these are the people we are in contact with every day. In many cases the finger is not pulling the trigger, rather the trigger pulls the finger. Domestic disputes often en in tragedy, but only because one person doesn't think the other will actually shoot them, likewise the person with the gun really doesn't want to kill the other, only even the scales. But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger. If the gun had not been present, it may have ended in a fistfight, or simply in one of the brothers being upset.\nRacial prejudice still exists today, the only real difference is that it is not as open as it was in the sixties. It is hard for me, a white middle class male, to say what prejudice is like for minorities today as opposed to 30 years ago.

Even minor provocations, such as getting in the way of someone's goal, can lead to frustration and, ultimately, aggressive acts of murder. These tragedies also underscore the flippancy with which Americans often view murder and other forms of violence. Through repeated exposure, perhaps we have become desensitized to violence. The media plays a significant role in this desensitization. For instance, when a character is shot, they often appear in the next scene, further normalizing such acts. This desensitization is particularly concerning for children, who may form unrealistic schemas regarding violence, and for men, who may become desensitized to sex crimes, potentially leading to an increase in such crimes. As potential parents, it is crucial to instill in our children \u2013 who will become future presidents, doctors, teachers, and even criminals \u2013 a true understanding of aggression and the importance of controlling it.\n\nRacial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago, and this decline is evident in various media forms. For example, cartoons and TV shows no longer publicly stereotype racial minorities. Attitudes regarding desegregation have also evolved, possibly as a result of the psychology of inevitability and cognitive dissonance. Through the media and other sources, some misconceptions are being cleared up, and more realistic information is being provided to the public.", "speed": 0.4113811770487175, "eta": "00h05m13s"}

This is due to the fact that human beings tend to become frustrated with those whom they like and love. When we encounter a stranger, we generally do not care enough about him to allow frustration to develop.

Trains are never on time. Everybody always has a complaint about some part of the transport system in the United Kingdom. What is wrong, and what can we do about it?\nThe amount of criticism aimed at the British rail network increases daily, and not without reason. Much of the rolling stock is old, slow, noisy and uncomfortable. Passengers whose life seems to revolve around annoying others - listening to not-quite-personal stereos, smoking in no smoking sections, putting bags on seat - are a common sight on trains. All this makes the train less appealling to the general public, and, in particular, the commuter.\nAnother problem is that of understaffing, both on trains and at stations. This leads to an increase in fare dodging, which is now quite possible unintentionally - with ticket offices closed at both ends of the journey, and no guard, who are you supposed to pay?\nAll this leads to trains being unprofitable, except on a few major commuter routes. Many things have been tried to reverse this, but to no avail. Closing small lines which regularly lose money may seem sensible but leads to less people getting trains in general - after all if you have to drive twenty miles to the nearest station, you might as well just drive to wherever you are going. Increasing or decreasing prices could be tried, but as trains are more expensive than cars for most journeys anyway, this would have little effect. \nThe only way to make profits is to get more people on trains, and this requires an improvement in services. This would initially cost a lot, and unfortunately sufficient funding is never available. \nAs more and more people use cars, traffic in city centres during rush ours comes to a near standstill. More cars arrive, get stuck in jams, and spread the congestion further and further out of the city, until motorways and bypasses become blocked.\nThe problem is obvious - there are too many cars on Britain's roads. There are two ways around the problem - reduce the number of cars, or build more roads.\nIn cities, where all traffic jams start, there is no room for more roads - every square yard is already in use.

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'. Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly. The M25 has already been dubbed 'the biggest car-park in Europe', and if current trends continue, the number of cars using it will double by 2030.\nA huge amount of pollution is chewed out by all those cars, contributing to global warming, acid rain and smog in cities. Although catalytic converters are now compulsory on new cars, fumes in cities have become so bad that scientists have linked them to a marked increase in the number of asthma sufferers. The emissions from diesel vehicles - cars, buses and lorries - are particularly harmful (just watch a bus start its engine, and observe the huge black cloud that belches forth from its exhaust pipe), and yet there is no control on these vehicles' exhaust.\nHundreds of people are killed on the roads every year, and as cars become faster and taffic denser, the number of accidents will surely increase. Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorries around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the road-haulage lobby on the government. Lorries create more noise and pollution than cars, and are much more damaging to the roads they travel on.\nNow that rail privatisation has gone ahead, many people are likely to lose faith in trains, due to the percieved inefficiency of the operators (for example the time-table book full of errors or the recent survey in Which? magazine about overcharging). Fares are likely to increase, and many rural lines that used to be subsidised by the government face closure. Very little freight is transposed by rail these days, so the railways have lost income due to this.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Britain's roads are increasingly becoming unsavory places due to severe congestion, particularly in urban areas.

Efforts to make fares cheaper and rail travel more family-friendly have been minimal, with the Family railcard being largely ineffective.\n\nUntil the rail service improves, people will continue to use the increasingly clogged roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution, as the number of cars on the roads will continue to grow to fill in the gaps. This is evident from the ongoing protests against the suspended work on the Newbury bypass, highlighting our limited options for expanding road infrastructure. One of the main side effects of road travel is pollution, with issues such as acid rain and asthma being widespread. As our fuel sources run out, the reliance on gas buses and gas stations becomes increasingly untenable. A renewable source must be found.\n\nSolutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful, necessitating a reconsideration of current approaches and policies to address the country's transportation challenges.", "speed": 0.4113811770487175, "eta": "00h05m13s"}

Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room. Away from cities road construction faces the problem of geographical sites.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Before any essay can be started, the key words in the essay title must be defined and understood. \"Main Problems\" in road and rail transport are significant issues that concern operators to the extent that they hinder operations. The essay will be organized into four sections. Firstly, the main problems of road transport will be identified and followed by suggested solutions. The same format will be applied to rail transport, emphasizing that their problems are entirely different in most respects and requiring separate arguments. Road transport encompasses a wide range of vehicles from bicycles to coaches, all carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of road transport is its limited capacity to hold a certain number of vehicles at any given time, resulting in ever-increasing congestion on most British roads, whether they are motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads are excluded from the focus of this essay.\n\nTraffic jams are on the rise due to two primary reasons: the sheer number of cars on the road and poor planning of road systems that were built before the extent of such congestion could be anticipated. One solution implemented in many cities is the introduction of one-way systems, where careful planning of routes may have alleviated the problem. The sheer volume of vehicles attempting to use the same roads simultaneously exacerbates congestion. 'A' roads into city-centers are heavily trafficked during rush hours, between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads could be free at night. Motorways also face peak-time congestion during holiday seasons. Another major problem is the limited potential for new road construction. Increasing numbers of protesters and environmentalists are blocking the construction of 'by-passes,' such as the Dwyford Downs. Although this is not a significant problem, it highlights that in densely populated cities where space is at a premium, new roads cannot be constructed due to spatial limitations. Away from cities, road construction is further hampered by geographical constraints. \n\nTo address these issues, it is essential to understand that effective solutions must be tailored to the unique challenges faced by both road and rail transport systems. By considering the diverse factors contributing to congestion and road construction challenges, we can develop more effective strategies to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce the impact of these problems.", "speed": 0.4113811770487175, "eta": "00h05m13s"}

Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK, with congestion and safety being some of the most talked-about issues for roads.

To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception.

This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish, and can travel \"door-to-door\" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years, due to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.\nI think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport. The government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements, such as the widening of motorways. This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport, with more services on the timetables, lower rates and less delays. These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid rate, then the roads will become completely congested, posing the main problem facing the UK's transport system.

Additionally, many feel unsafe walking or using public transport, particularly mothers who insist on driving their children to school, as they believe there are too many child abductors. These concerns are heightened by high-profile cases like the James Bulger case and the Fred and Mary West case.\n\nThe convenience of cars also contributes to their popularity. Unlike public transport, cars allow for flexible travel timing and door-to-door convenience, making public buses and trains less appealing. As a result, cycling has become less acceptable, both due to safety concerns and pollution levels caused by heavy traffic.\n\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years due to the immense popularity of cars.

Do we, the western world (5% of the global population), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost? Just because we can't be bothered to get out of bed a bit earlier to catch public transport. Even if we did, the rest of the world would quickly follow suit, leading to disastrous implications.\n\nThe second reason is the problem with the public transport service, such as rail. For example, trains have declined so much that there is often no train to catch in the morning. People stopped using trains due to the fall in standards, routes became unprofitable, and services were cut back and closed, forcing more people onto the roads. The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use.\n\nThis has now been intensified with the sale of the railways to private companies, whose profit motivations have further complicated the situation.", "speed": 0.3694789354791979, "eta": "00h04m22s"}

This means that in many areas candidates are elected with under 50% of the total vote within that constituency. These successful candidate move on to the House of Commons to become MPs.

However there are strengths to this system. The first past the post system always leads to strong government usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the conservatives in the early 1960's was done through the first past the post system; The other option is proportional representation which is seen to give more say to the electorate on who get elected.

Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.\nIt is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls at the first hurdle. With this system any madman can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.\nThere is no fair and perfect way to run a country. One please some people some of the time, but not all people all of the time. The only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most, and even then people are discontent.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The British parliamentary electoral system is often criticized as unfair and undemocratic. However, I believe it remains the most effective basis for government. Consider a general election in a country with 5000 voters, where three parties\u2014X, Y, and Z\u2014compete for power. Suppose party X receives 2000 votes while parties Y and Z combine to get 1500 votes. Under this system, party X would come into power as it has the most votes. However, this result does not represent the majority's preference, with 3000 voters opposing party X. This raises questions about the system's democratic nature.\n\nMoreover, the concept of each constituency having a Member of Parliament (MP) who represents its beliefs in parliament comes with significant flaws. For instance, MPs may switch parties, complicating voters' ability to choose representatives based on consistent beliefs. This situation highlights a disconnect between voter intentions and MPs' actions, particularly during elections. Once a party comes into power, it often shifts policies, making promises during campaigns that may not be fulfilled in practice. This cycle can lead to a lack of accountability and trustworthy governance.\n\nAlthough I acknowledge these issues, it is important to consider that no electoral system is flawless. Dictatorships, for example, clearly fail by concentrating power in the hands of a single individual or group, which can result in economic disasters affecting not only the country in power but also its neighbors.\n\nUltimately, it is challenging to devise a perfectly fair system of government, as no system can please everyone at all times. In smaller groups of about ten people, the potential for discontent remains, but even then, achieving a universally satisfying system is difficult.

In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life.

It can run for its life and sometimes escapes, but usually it is just delaying the inevitable.\n\nHow can a 20-on-1 chase be seen as fair or good sport, it is often argued. How such a thing can be considered sport is beyond me. It is sometimes argued that they can mount the fox back at home, but most times the fox is so damaged by the gunshot wound that only its head is mountable. It is a waste to see these beautiful creatures hung up on walls for show when their numbers are dwindling. This raises disgust in other countries and can even be laughable; why do we British cling to such a cruel and heartless exercise?\n\nI wonder if the people who partake in this sport would like to be chased down by bloodhounds and people with guns, while they themselves were unarmed. It seems that the upper class people who run these hunts think they own everything\u2014the land, the fox\u2014and obviously think they have the right to kill these creatures.\n\nThis ancient English tradition threatens to wipe out the fox altogether from its natural environment as more and more are shifting to the city because food is easier to find. In effect, they are depriving their grandchildren of experiencing foxes by either driving them out or killing them.\n\nFarmers also complain about foxes killing their sheep. This argument fails to recognize the greater cruelty and inhumanity of fox hunting itself.", "speed": 0.3694789354791979, "eta": "00h04m22s"}

Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing. Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side, should boxing be banned?\nEvery time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull. This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage. In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing.\nThe sport to say the least is actually a blood sport, the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to 'knock your opposition out', although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form, he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points. \nBut there is one exception - the original example, the first reference why boxing should be banned, the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank (the man who doesn't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out).\nThis example only proves too well what a dangerous so called 'sport' boxing is.\nThe boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the 'spot' safer having rungside doctors, banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Two men, one ring, only one can leave. This dramatic premise underscores the fundamental principle of boxing: the competition to emerge as the sole survivor. While rules have evolved over the years to lessen the sport's sadistic aspects, the question remains\u2014should boxing be banned? Every time a boxer takes a punch to the head, their brain vigorously moves within the skull. This motion causes the loss of brain cells, which, when repeated frequently, can lead to long-term brain damage and potentially end a boxer's career prematurely. In my eyes\u2014and likely many others\u2014this is sufficient reason to ban boxing.\n\nDespite its violent nature, boxing is often described as a blood sport, primarily because the goal is to incapacitate an opponent. Chris Eubank, a prominent boxer, argues that boxing is an art form, stating he aims not merely to knock out his opponent but to win by points. He believes in giving respect to opponents and that his fights are won based on skill rather than sheer violence. Yet, there is one stark exception that highlights the sport's inherent danger: the tragic incident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank, the very boxer who doesn't claim to fight to knock opponents out. This incident serves as a chilling reminder of boxing's potential for harm.\n\nEfforts by the boxing federation to make the sport safer have included the presence of ring-side doctors and the banning of bare-knuckle fights. However, the bottom line remains clear: any blow to the head can cause significant damage. The undeniable risk posed by boxing challenges the notion of its place in modern sports.", "speed": 0.3694789354791979, "eta": "00h04m22s"}

During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.\nThe brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.\nAnother aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.\nThe major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it.

One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid.

A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true.

This century it's popularity has increased greatly, due on part to the personalities of such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.\nHowever there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in the ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of \"Prince\" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.\nThis apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport. When this behaviour is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.\nWhilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as other sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Boxing has existed in its popular form from the last century, and has taken large steps of development since its early days of backstreet bare-knuckle fights.

While such behavior cannot be condoned, it's essential to remember that boxers, like other athletes, are aware of the risks associated with their chosen profession. This is highlighted by the fact that when Jim Murray died, calls for the abolition of boxing were made. However, a similar tragedy involving Ayrton Senna during the 1994 Imola race did not result in calls to ban motor racing.

Many opponents to boxing argue that this risk in itself means that boxing is not a sport but is malicious and these boxers ought not be allowed to make that decision especially when they have families.\nduring the last year/two years there have been incidents which the sport of boxing wants to forget and try and get boxing it's name of 'entertainment' back. The arguament came to the fore again that boxing ought to be banned when Chris Eubank fought Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed and with brain damage. These two men were both professional fighters, the fact that Michael Watson has ended up how he is, is as much Michael Watson's fault for putting himself there as it is Chris Eubank's for doing it to him. However Michael Watson has never been able to forgive Chris Eubank, and many critics believe, that as sport is for enjoyment, no sporting event should end up with opponents not speaking to each other because it turns it into a war, which means a higher likelihood of someone being seriously hurt.\nAnother incident very similar to this was between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, and Gerald McClelland end up in a wheelchair. However months after this, McClelland friend Oliver McCall threatened to take revenge from McClelland on Frank Bruno. Many people say that this 'idol' talk sets a bad example for children when growing up. They don't only see, a 'superstar' in Oliver McCall threatening to paralyse Bruno but revenge is also threatened. \nThese are tragic events that no-one wants seen repeated and many opposers to boxing believe that it should not be allowed to happen again by banning the sport.\nOnly I the recent case of James Murray who tragically died was the issue brought up again.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Boxing, a sport with two sides, captivates audiences with the excitement of watching great fighters such as Mohamed Ali, Chris Eubank, and more recently 'Prince' Naseem Hamed.

However, it is undeniable that boxing is dangerous; every time a boxer enters the ring, they risk their lives. Many opponents argue that this inherent risk makes boxing not a sport but a dangerous and even malicious activity, yet allowing fighters to make this decision is especially concerning when they have families.\n\nIn recent years, the sport has faced significant scrutiny, with two major incidents prompting calls for boxing to be banned or relegated to being known merely as 'entertainment.' This controversy resurfaced prominently during the match between Chris Eubank and Michael Watson, which resulted in Watson's paralysis and brain damage. The fact that both men were professional fighters complicates the issue, but it remains evident that Watson's fate was a tragic result of their participation. This incident raises questions about the nature of sports for enjoyment and whether the lack of communication between once-fighting opponents signals a shift toward a more dangerous, war-like atmosphere.\n\nAnother tragic example involved Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, where McClelland ended up in a wheelchair. However, the repercussions extended beyond the ring when McClelland's friend, Oliver McCall, threatened to take revenge on Frank Bruno, the 'idol' in question. This behavior sets a concerning example for children, who witness not just the physical harm but also the moral implications of seeking revenge.\n\nThese tragic events highlight why many opponents to boxing believe the sport should be banned to prevent further occurrences. The recent case of James Murray, who tragically died, reignited the debate, underscoring the urgent need for a reassessment of the sport's role and safety measures.\n\nThus, while boxing offers excitement and showcases extraordinary talent, it is crucial to address the potential dangers and consider the far-reaching consequences of its practice.

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The National Lottery was criticized before its introduction as \"a tax on the stupid.\" This criticism has two main facets. Firstly, it targets the government for attempting to raise additional revenue through the lottery without introducing a new tax. The government, aware of the widespread unpopularity of taxation, faced objections for marketing the lottery as a game while essentially raising funds. Critics were concerned not only about the government's share of lottery proceeds but also about the amount being allocated to \"good causes.\" The slogan \"it could be you\" was heavily scrutinized.\n\nSecondly, the criticism aimed at the lottery's marketing practices. Critics argued that marketing companies emphasized the likelihood of winning despite the statistical improbabilities. Despite this initial criticism, recent studies have demonstrated that most people have a reasonable view of the lottery, spending within their means. Contrary to fears, it was shown that lottery spending increases with income, with the poor spending the least and the rich the most. This suggests that the original critics may have overstated the number of people influenced by the lottery's appeal.\n\nThe criticism directed at the government was based on transparency about the allocation of lottery funds. All forms of gambling, including the National Lottery, are taxed, and most consumer spending is subject to Value Added Tax. Consequently, it would be unreasonable to expect the government to exempt the lottery from taxation.\n\nAdditionally, the National Lottery faced criticism for how it represented the breakdown of funds to various causes, notably charities. Critics argued that the contributions to charity were exaggerated, suggesting that the actual support for these causes would be significantly less impacted by the lottery's introduction than initially portrayed.", "speed": 0.3694789354791979, "eta": "00h04m22s"}

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points.

The basic principlees behind the lottery are that a small  number of people are able to become monumentally rich from the contributions of many. Despite objections, the vast majority of lottery players see it as harmless fun which won't break the bank.\nThe main objection to the lottery is based on the grounds that those who play it most are those who can afford it the least. Many Britons are in situations of poverty where the lack of employment prospects and the deterioration of the welfare state means that the lottery is seen as the only way to solve their problems.

They had been promised a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) going to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon.

Although the National Lottery allocates a very small portion of its earnings to charity, international charities that save millions of lives annually would receive less than a school that wants to build a new sports hall.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and other more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would have been donated to charity.\nAnother objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more on the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young people (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people. \nFinally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as \u00a340 million.

It can take quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).\n\tIt is possible to say that using computers do not stop us using our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After all somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.\n\tPeople claim that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping your finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\tDespite computers saving time, they do everything for you at the touch of a button, solve the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This is why it could be said we don't use our brains as much.\n\tFrom simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. In the control room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. I cannot see much brain power needed for that.\n\tComputers can communiate with each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I think that it is possible to argue that the computer has made us both use and not use our brains for a number of reasons. Firstly, the introduction of computers has made us think more due to the numerous programs we use. Learning to navigate these programs can take quite a while, and as soon as one program or computer is released, it quickly becomes outdated because people are constantly thinking about improving it. After all, it was humans who invented the computer in the first place; computers can't replace the human brain (at least, not yet).\n\nIt is possible to say that using computers does not stop us from using our brains as much; instead, they serve as quick, efficient time-savers. For example, consider the difference between using a word processing program and writing with an old-fashioned typewriter. If you were to make a mistake writing an important letter, you would have to start over, whereas a single key press on a computer can eliminate such errors.\n\nPeople often claim that computer games do not require brainpower to be played. However, some games are so challenging that people from around the world consult with each other to solve them. This collaboration, facilitated by computers, is a quick, efficient way to communicate and solve complex problems. Yet, there are also computer games that require no brainpower at all, simply keeping your finger on a button, which showcases another way computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\nDespite the time-saving capabilities of computers, they can perform almost every task with a single touch. They can solve difficult mathematical sums, check for spelling errors in essays, letters, and other documents, and much more. This efficiency could lead to the argument that we are not using our brains as much. From simple tasks like doing homework to complex operations such as running a nuclear power station, computers handle everything. For instance, at the Hesselam's Nuclear Power Station control room, one man can manage millions of pounds' worth of computers, while the rest of us sit back and let them do the work.\n\nComputers have even taken on more advanced roles, such as communicating with each other, flying planes, and building cars. In the future, computers may even be running the country, highlighting the dual nature of their impact on our use of the brain.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

Yet there are many situations where humans can travel through on foot that wheeled vehicles cannot cope, as any wheel-chair bound person would testify. The computer is a tool to be used to aid human brains and bodies, but does not (yet) come close to making them redundant.\n\tRecently, a fuss was made in the newspapers over falling ability at mental arithmetic in schoolchildren. This was attributed to the rising use of calculators in schools, and newspaper articles claimed that children were losing their ability to think for themselves, due to overuse of calculators. Surely, though, it is poor teaching on the part of primary school teachers, and the fault of our `progressive' teaching policy, that allows children to pass on memorising times tables in favour of simply having calculators at the ready at all times?\n\tThe reason that computers have not made the human brain redundant is that they are, in the most literal sense of the word, idiotic. They have no ability to think, or be creative, or be spontaneous. They simply perform millions of calculations, very quickly, following instructions laid out by a human. It is impossible for a computer to produce a list of truly random numbers, for example, something an eight-year old child can do with ease. The closest that can happen is for a programmer to invent an appropriately complicated set of instructions (an algorithm) that will deliver an approximation of a set of random numbers. Of course, once this is done, the computer can quickly calculate millions of (pseudo) random numbers far more quickly than a human.\n\tResearch in artificial intelligence, the attempt to produce a \"thinking\" computer, has grown massively in the last decade, yet we are little closer to producing any true artificial life for it. The definition of artificial life that is now most widely used was set out in the 1950's. It involves a set up of three computers, linked so that what one person types on his screen appears also on the other two.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Many people wonder how far a human foot has become redundant with the invention of the wheel, akin to asking, \"How far has the human foot been made redundant by the invention of the wheel?\" Computers excel at jobs requiring repetitive mathematical calculations, much as wheel-based vehicles often outperform travel on foot.

The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the \"problem\".

Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one. Computers nowadays are a far cry from the ones in the past, which filled whole rooms. They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds. This technological advancement has made computers a crucial part of our lives both in work and education; however, we must ask whether they are entirely beneficial.\n\nWhen calculators became commonplace, a noticeable decline in students' ability to perform mental arithmetic was evident. Now, computers handle the simplest calculations, leading some to argue that they encourage laziness. While computers are undeniably time-saving and efficient, they also cause people to forget basic skills, such as spelling. This reliance on technology is concerning, as spell-check may offer convenience, but it undermines the importance of the skill itself.\n\nFor the youth today, computers provide links to the world and vast resources of facts and figures. Some may argue this is educational, but it could also stifle imagination. Children might spend hours at a keyboard, confined to the digital realm, rather than engaging in real-life experiences. Instead of sitting in darkness at night, they should be enjoying daylight activities and adventures.\n\nThe idea that computers enable us to meet people and form relationships through digital interactions seems preposterous to many. This shift threatens our ability to communicate and build genuine connections in person. Further, while computers offer an escape from the humdrum routine of daily life through games, they often fail to stimulate creativity and invention, becoming mind-numbing and uninteresting.\n\nHowever, there is also a more dangerous threat from computers: the potential for them to replace human labor. This could lead to high unemployment, especially for those who work with computers for long periods. The repetitive nature of key tapping and screen staring can be harmful, both physically and mentally. Boredom and lack of engagement can take a toll.\n\nAs we contemplate the future, we must consider the role that computers will play in shaping it. It is essential to find a balance that allows us to leverage technological advancements while maintaining our essential human skills and connections. Only by doing so can we ensure that computers serve as a valuable tool without diminishing our humanity.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

It is in my view therefore that it is press blowing the situation out of all proportions that will be the down fall of beef in the U.K. It was not long ago that the press anounced a killer bug eating people alive, thus catching the attention of the U.K. When the press got bored of this story, the bug dissappeared and with it peoples worries about its effects.

When the story lost its allure, the bug and public concern about its effects disappeared too. As a result, \"out of sight, out of mind\" became a reality. If beef continues to be absent from public consciousness, along with other concerns such as Salmonella and killer bugs, its demand will inevitably decline.\n\nSchools and some hospitals are increasingly promoting \"beef-free\" policies, which is causing a fall in beef demand in the U.K. This reduced demand is leading to a significant drop in beef prices, affecting farmers' and the industry's income. The simple supply and demand curve illustrates how a decrease in beef demand leads to lower prices; however, reducing supply drastically to align with lower demand would mean slaughtering and disposing of hundreds of beef cattle.

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products.

This increase has been blown out of proportion by the British press who have given the idea to the public that eating British beef can lead to the human equivalent. C.J.D, in its worst cases, can cause death, however, they majority of cases involve severe damage to the brain, leaving most sufferers totally dependant on others. It is also the case, however, that the link between the consumption of British beef and C.J.D has certainly not been proven, infact from testing on mice it seems unlikely. Even though figures have risen in the U.K concerning the number of deaths resulting from C.J.D, this is considered by most experts to be merely due to the advances in medical technology so that they are now able to diagnose more cases, which would have previously gone unreported. A further factor which is often not realised is that the occurrence of C.J.D is not only limited to this country, infact the Netherlands has a higher resultant death rate.

In its most severe instances, C.J.D can be fatal; however, the majority of cases result in severe brain damage, leaving sufferers dependent on others. Despite these alarming developments, the direct correlation between consuming British beef and contracting C.J.D remains unproven; studies on mice have cast doubt on this link. While the rise in reported C.J.D cases in the U.K. might be attributed in part to improved medical technology and more accurate diagnoses, it is also important to note that the Netherlands has a higher death rate from C.J.D. Although lower, the U.S.A also experiences cases of C.J.D. \n\nTherefore, the recent beef scare, amplified by the media, could have detrimental effects on the British farming community.

All of these diseases are similar in progression and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are called <?>, or protein fragments, and are tiny non-living infectious particles. They must be actively taken in by an animal (i.e. they must be eaten) to have any effect. They are very resilient to heat and so cooking possibly infected food does not help.

After a while, as often happens, people largely forgot about BSE, but it didn't go away. The problem was that increasing numbers of herd animals were having to be destroyed as they displayed BSC symptoms. However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?\" The government reply was along lines of: \"Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten,\" i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then a recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country. The government strenuously denied this, making matters worse, and as nobody knows the real situation or even if CJD can be caught from eating infected beef, many people would seem unwilling to take the risk.

Learning that one has contracted the disease can take up to seven years, which has contributed to public attitudes such as, \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\" and, \"There have been no victims, so I should ignore the warnings.\" The most popular option, though, seems to be to be safe and quit beef entirely. Consequently, more families are opting for alternative meats such as chicken, pork, or lamb.\n\nThe situation could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry. If demand decreases significantly, farmers might reduce beef production, potentially leading them to switch to alternative products, fundamentally altering the industry's landscape.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.\nThe reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.\nIf these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers this would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and know nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.\nI personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government. The government wants to be self-sufficient, and also keep unemployment as low as possible, so the government will start to buy up surpluses. <figure> In this situation, at price P, more is supplied, than demanded, but this intervention price means that the farmers can produce what they like, as they get to sell their surplus anyway.\nAll this will do for the agricultural industry is ensure farmers can predict their income for the next year. This is because once these \"price-support schemes\" are started, they are very difficult to take down again.\nIn conclusion, although this is a dangerous disease that may be contractable, the agricultural industry will not fall by as greater degree as anticipated.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Recently, the consumption of beef in the UK has fallen dramatically, leading to many problems not only for beef farmers but also for the broader economy, as the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.

Firstly, it may be in response to the protests at ports trying to prevent calves being exported where they may be used as veal calves and put into veal crates, which are uncomfortable for the animal and have been banned for many years in the UK. Scenes of calves in these crates or of protests (in which one protester has been killed) at the ports both on television or in newspapers may have persuaded people to either become vegetarian or at least stop eating beef. The emergence of BSE among cattle (so called 'mad cow disease' because of the effects it has upon the animal) and the linked (or possibly linked) CJD (Kreutzfeld-Jacobs disease) have alarmed consumers so much so that many schools have banned beef from the menu. Despite the risk of contracting CJD which is minutely small and the fact that the number of cases per year has stayed roughly the same i.e. is not increasing, the media hype has blown the disease out of all proportion and people are now very wary of eating beef, resorting to other products instead such as lamb.\n\tThe effect on the agricultural industry, <?> beef producers is catastrophic.

Any farmer with a substantial number of cattle relies on the sale of beef for their financial stability. A sudden shift in public taste away from beef can leave dairy farmers with cattle they cannot sell. When there is little demand for a product, there is little point in producing it. Therefore, if demand for beef decreases, fewer farmers will have cattle to slaughter, which will have a ripple effect on suppliers of cattle materials like feed and services such as slaughterhouses.\n\nWhile the industry claims the drop in meat consumption is due to seasonal tastes, and many farmers are tolerating low prices, there is no sign of a market recovery. Eventually, the decreased production of cattle for slaughter will negatively impact suppliers of cattle materials. To counteract this trend, some governments may consider establishing subsidies to encourage farmers, but this would only address the symptoms without tackling the root cause: the UK public's willingness to believe the worst.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "\"In Vitro fertilisation\" (IVF) is the process of fertilising an egg in the laboratory, such as in a test tube. The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment optimized for fertilisation by sperm from the father. Once fertilisation occurs, the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mother's womb, and from there on, the pregnancy follows a normal course. Typically, more than one egg is retrieved from the mother to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy, leading to multiple births like twins or triplets.\n\nHowever, some people oppose IVF, arguing that it is not natural and that life should start from the moment of conception. They raise ethical concerns, such as who should be given the treatment, the appropriate age for undergoing it, and whether it is justifiable to spend significant amounts of money on IVF when those funds could instead save numerous lives through measles vaccinations. Proponents of IVF argue that it is a person's right to have their own children. For women who would normally be unable to conceive due to conditions like blocked fallopian tubes, IVF offers a fair chance to have children, regardless of their age or health conditions.\n\nAs technology has advanced rapidly, ethical and practical guidelines have not always kept pace, leading to debates about regulations. One example of this is the case of a post-menopausal woman who was given IVF treatment by lying about her age. \n\nGiven these complexities, it is crucial to ensure that fertility treatments are administered responsibly. Regulations should be in place to ensure that fertility treatments are only given when medically appropriate and ethically justified, considering both the potential benefits and the broader implications for society.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

I find this to be a difficult issue to agree or oppose as only being young and having my life ahead it is quite easy to say that it is disgraceful women of late 50's having children and they had their chance and they let it go but if at fifty and maybe you put your career first all your life and now want a family should you not be given the chance and is it not how old you are but what kind of a mother you would be?

People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.\n\tBodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Science has made significant strides since the C19th, resulting in numerous medical advancements and inventions.

IVF has been around for over a decade and still is the centre of difficulties and conflicts. IVF pushes all parties involved with to the limit, morally, legally and ethically.\n\tThe first argument is that of the parents. These people can be like anyother healthy, successful etc. but infertile. Should they have the right to 'buy' themselves a baby? I think so. If they can afford the treatment and deal with the issues surrounding it, then they should go ahead. A child will make them happy and feel complete as a family and everyone has the right to feel that. Those with less money, however either have to not bother, take years saving up or adopt - but this is not the same as having your own biological baby.\n\tProblems which may arise for the parents are mainly the chances of the treatment being unsuccessful. This can be a major disappointment especially if the couple have spent all their savings on the treatment. They could even get into debt if they wanted to try again. There is the ethical issue if on finding out if the baby will be deformed or mentally ill in anyway whether to abort the foetus or not.\n\tFertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of the most controversial issues when discussing IVF. They have their own personal reasons for why they want a baby at that stage of life. Most people disagree with it from the start without even hearing the argument from the mother. This is because they probably see it as unnatural to continue (or <?> having children when the body is not biologically prepared for it. Personally, I think that this is only acceptable when the woman has married or wants to start a family with a younger partner. This is where the rights of the child comes in.\n\tIf the parents are still relitavely young, then the child will in most cases have a reasonable quality of life. If a post menopausal woman has a child then in a very high majority of cases she will be at least 45-50 years of age and will be an O.A.P.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of many treatments associated with medical ethics, and its existence over a decade has continued to be the center of difficulties and conflicts, pushing all parties involved to the limits morally, legally, and ethically. \n\nThe first argument concerns the parents.

An egg, is taken from the womans ovaries and sperm is produced by the male under controlled conditions. They will hopefully be fertilized and a embroyo will start to grow. The embroyo will then be placed in the womens womb where it is hoped that a normal pregnancy will take place.\n\tThere are obviously many moral dilemmas for and against this issue.

They have always wanted to have a child and now they have one. A dilemma, which may arise here, is have the parents the right to have a second child through IVF treatment.\n\tUnfortunatly, the disadvantages of IVF treatment largely outweigh the advantages. Huge sums of money are involved in this treatment, as it can only be done very rarely on the National Health Service. Normally, the couple have to come up with the money themselves and perhaps it can be even said that they are buying a child. Money which perhaps some couples don't have. The treatment may take many years to work with an enormous cost.\n\tThe financial hardship and the constant disappointment may also put a strain on what used to be an ideal marriage.\nThe doctors who carry out this treatment are currently making a lot of money from it, is this right?\n\tIn my opinion, there should be some regulations. Lets look at a) fertility treatment for post-menopausal women. Unless, there is a resonnable argument for example, early menopause taking place there should be some regulations. If a women goes for this treatment, and has a baby when she is 55 what kind of life will that child have? When, it reaches its early teens the mother will be nearly 70. I think that there should be an age limit on fertility treatment. But, if the couple are funding the venture privatly this would be hard to stop. It would be important though to look at, what type of quality of life would the child lead?\nIn some especially, earlier on in the days of treatment multiple births took place.

This financial burden can be significant and potentially strain relationships.\n\nMoreover, the financial strain and repeated disappointment from unsuccessful treatments can impact the couple's marriage. Additionally, doctors profiting from this lucrative treatment raise ethical concerns. In my opinion, some regulations are necessary, starting with fertility treatment for post-menopausal women. Unless there is a compelling reason, such as early menopause, it would be prudent to introduce age limits on fertility treatments. However, if couples privately fund the process, imposing such restrictions would be challenging. It is crucial to consider the quality of life that a child conceived through IVF and born at an older age would experience.\n\nIn the early days of IVF, there were instances of multiple births, where a woman gave birth to seven babies instead of the usual single baby.

In vitro ie. in a natural environment.\nThis gives couples who could not naturally have children the ability to have their own family without adopting.\na) Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women enables parents to start a family later in life. This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged to have children for her partner. Having a child is stressful at any age but if the mother is older when the child very young she may not have the energy to get up four times every night etc.\n\tTherefore, although I agree with fertility treatment for post menopausal women I think that upper age limits should be applied. Also, I think the women should have a form of councelling before hand so that they are aware of how much more stressful it is to bring up children later in life.\nb) Sex Selection.\n\tThis form of genetic engineering allows the parents to choose their own child. Therefore, couples who only want boys could do so. However, if a couple could only love one gender of child should they have one? Although in principle the idea of choosing children is not a bad one, where would it stop? If this is acceptable then choosing blonde hair and blue eyes may also become acceptable. This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the parents may find it hard to love the child.

This can be beneficial as it allows them to develop their careers earlier, resulting in greater financial security before having children. Additionally, women who have previously divorced can find new relationships with the possibility of having more children, which can sometimes strengthen these relationships. However, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks of having children at an older age. Post-menopausal mothers are less likely to have the energy and capacity to care for children as they age, and the risk of illness may impact their ability to provide stable support. Furthermore, if fertility treatment is readily available, older women may feel pressured to have children simply to fulfill their partner's desires. While I support fertility treatments for post-menopausal women, I advocate for implementing upper age limits and ensuring that women are provided with pre-conception counseling to fully understand the challenges involved in raising children later in life. \n\nSex Selection, a form of genetic engineering, offers couples the opportunity to choose their preferred child. This technology may seem acceptable in principle, but it raises questions about its broader implications. If parents can choose the gender of their child, what other characteristics might they select? This could lead to significant changes in the population, such as preferences for physical appearance or other traits. Additionally, in the event of a treatment mishap resulting in the wrong gender, parents may struggle emotionally to love the child. In countries like China, where the one-child policy has been implemented, the preference for male children has led to tragic consequences, including the abandonment of baby girls. As a result, the ethical implications of sex selection and genetic engineering warrant careful consideration and regulation.", "speed": 0.36486156718823926, "eta": "00h02m58s"}

Is it the blind persuit of knowledge and the discovery of the unknown, or is it to inplement and use the ideas and discoverys of his own, or of others. In my opinion the answer to this question is the former, a scientist uncovers what is unknown. The latter lies more in the relms of business.\n\tI would consider it difficult for a scientist to shoulder the responsibility for his or her work, if his discoveries were implemented by others, for example, could Einstin, one of the greatest scientests of the 20th century, be held responsible for the development of the atom bomb, or more reacently, the catastrophies at three mile island or at chenobyl. Einsteins work layed down the theoretical basis for nuclear weapons, and the implementation of the nuclear weapons program provided the catalyst for the development of nuclear electricity generation. can we blame Einstein for this.\n\tThis brings out several points: in a non money motivated world it is highly likely that if one scientist forsees dangers of his discoveries, he will discontinue it, he cannot however prevent others continuing his work, and he cannot ensure that the disoveries will not be made by others. In the real money motivated world, these are two pressures pushing him to continue his work, money being the most important: if he sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to contue his work. The other pressure is fame and the delight in being <?>. There are thousands of scientists who have achieved imortality through their work. All of this argument depends on the scientist seeing the potential dangers on his work. However, very often the scientist is blind to all the effects that his work may have. They often have an aim, a potential use for his work: it is likely that other implementations of his work are likely, and for the scientist difficult to see.\n\tAlso, how can a scientist take moral responsibility for a discovery made by pure luck. take this extreem example: a chemical researcher deliberately, without knowledge of its effects, mixes chemicals which result in the production of an unknown but deadly <?> gas which kills the entire staff of his research department. As the scientist is not at the fore front of his sience, the death of his collegues is not his fault.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "A scientist's job is often a subject of debate: Is it the blind pursuit of knowledge and the discovery of the unknown, or the implementation and use of ideas, whether his own or others'?

Could Einstein, one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, be held responsible for the development of the atom bomb, or more recently, the catastrophes at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl? Einstein's work laid the theoretical foundation for nuclear weapons, and the subsequent development of the nuclear weapons program provided the catalyst for nuclear electricity generation. Can we blame Einstein for this?\n\nThese points highlight several issues: in a non-monetary world, it's likely a scientist who foresees the dangers of his discoveries would discontinue it. He cannot prevent others from continuing his work, nor can he ensure that his discoveries won't be made by others. In the real, money-driven world, these pressures push him to continue his work, with money being the most significant factor: if he sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to continue his work. The other pressure is fame\u2014scientists achieve immortality through their work. This argument hinges on the scientist recognizing the potential dangers of his work.

Eventually it will be possible to eliminate genetically in herited diseases such as haemophillia and cistic fibrosis. This will be done by mapping the entire human genome. This will enable scientists to know precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.\n\tGenetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids for circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.\n\tGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a very simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need.\n\tCrops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to draught, pests and disease.\n\tIn the future it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. This is immoral as superhumans would be created for specific jobs for example huge men with lots of muscle small heads and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or for boxing.\n\tScientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal. This should not include mental ability as this would also be immoral. Genetic manipulation should not be used to change normal humans into superhumans.\n\tIt must be scientists to bear the burden as these are the people who have the knowledge to create the superhumans.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Genetic manipulation holds the promise of a future where inherited diseases like hemophilia and cystic fibrosis can be eliminated. This future hinges on the ability to map the entire human genome, which would allow scientists to understand the function of each gene. With this detailed knowledge, genes that cause diseases can be identified in the fetus. Should these genes be detected, they can be replaced with healthy ones, potentially curing the condition before it manifests.\n\nGenetic Engineering, as a method of producing substances lacking in the human body, has already proven invaluable. For instance, the human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids within bacteria. These genetically modified bacteria, which also contained an antibiotic resistance gene, were then allowed to reproduce, producing insulin that could be extracted and administered to diabetics. This method is preferable to extracting insulin from cow's liver, and it demonstrates how genetic engineering can be critical to treating certain diseases, allowing those affected to live relatively healthy lives.\n\nIn the realm of agriculture, genetic manipulation has also been applied through selective breeding. For example, cows have been bred over generations to produce more milk by combining cows with genetic traits that favor higher milk production. Similarly, crops have been engineered to yield more and withstand various challenges, such as drought, pests, and diseases, thus improving food security.\n\nLooking ahead, there is potential to alter the physical and mental capabilities of humans. However, this prospect is fraught with ethical concerns. The creation of 'superhumans' for specific roles, such as enhanced fighters, raises serious moral issues. To prevent such misuse, stringent controls must be established over genetic manipulation, ensuring it serves to help disadvantaged individuals rather than creating superhumans. Mental ability alterations should not be pursued, as this too would be morally indefensible.\n\nThe responsibility for regulating these powerful technologies lies with scientists. As the experts with the necessary knowledge and skills to create 'superhumans,' they must bear the burden of ensuring that genetic manipulation is used responsibly, to improve lives rather than creating inequality or unethical outcomes. Genetic manipulation should aim to normalize disadvantaged people, not transform them into superhumans.", "speed": 0.3829489840348685, "eta": "00h01m26s"}

Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and there is a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans. The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, and indeed he may, there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. And indeed this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered. But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon.\n\tWe can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject. But are we right to blame him? Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering. It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask, should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences. Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world? In truth no, it is unreasonable.\n\tGenetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin. The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down's Syndrome. There is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones.

The trouble is that even though a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, there is still so much we do not know about genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. Indeed, this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust, many wish it had never been discovered, yet it is wrong to blame the scientists who first started the research and had no idea it could be used as a weapon. \n\nWe can argue that a scientist must have the greatest realization of a discovery's uses, good or bad, as they are the experts on the subject. But are we right to blame them? Consider that a scientist discovers a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering. It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask, should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences? Can we expect a scientist to bear this additional burden for the entire world? In truth, it is unreasonable.\n\nGenetic engineering is developing rapidly and has already been used extensively in plants and bacteria, notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and human insulin. The natural next step is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down's Syndrome. There is, however, considerable resistance and fear that we may unintentionally manufacture mutants or create an army of superhuman clones.

Throughout the world, scientists working on the Human Genome Project are involved in the monumental task of mapping human DNA, an endeavor that involves understanding millions of genes on each chromosome.

Scientists can now manipulate genes so successfully that they can literally create almost anything they want to.\n\tThere are, of course, both good and bad sides to this. Starting with the good aspects, however, since this is the fundamental usage of genetic engineering.\n\tThe story that hit the scientific press about two years ago was about the \"Stay-ripe\" tomato. It was an ordinary tomato which had genes from a wheat variety added to it creating a tomato that, once ripe, stayed red for weeks. This is a major advantage to supermarket chains who often import their fruit from French suppliers. The problem with this is that it often goes bad in transport, and so it substandard when it arrived. The new tomato will not do this, so they get more tomatoes per cargo than otherwise they would have done.\n\tThere have also been stories about barley and other cash crops being treated, so that disease and pest resistance is inbedded in the genes. Some can even produce pesticides themselves, a characteristic aquired from another plant. These crops are ideal for third-world countries where their native crop usually is found, but is being destroyed by a pest which is out of control. They do not have the capital for large scale pesticide projects, so these plants are ideal. They could eben ve engineered to produce larger quantities.\n\tHowever, genetic manipulation can also be used to recreate dead organisms. Due to government restrictions, the creation or recreation of animal life is illegal, but it has been done with a type of clover, usually found in the south of France, but seemed to disappear completely.\n\tPeople who think genetic engineering is going to recreate dinosaurs, or create strange creatures are living in a dream world controlled by paranoia. This is all science-fiction, not at all fact. We are decader away from understanding how to do this, and even then, there is only a tiny chance of it working. So, the harmful aspects of genetic manipulation are very few in number, and most people need not concern themselves with worrying about it.\n\tThe only forseeable effect is releasing something which has an effect which is unknown to those who release it. For example, it might kill off other plantlife, or grow out of control.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Genetics has come a long, long way over the last few years.

This tomato incorporates genes from a wheat variety, allowing it to stay red for weeks once it ripens. This innovation is particularly beneficial for supermarket chains that often import fruits from French suppliers, as the traditional tomatoes tend to become substandard during transport. The \"Stay-ripe\" tomato mitigates this issue, ensuring fresher produce upon arrival and reducing waste.\n\nAdditionally, there have been stories about crops like barley being genetically treated to include disease and pest resistance. Some of these crops can even produce their own pesticides by acquiring this trait from other plants. These advancements are particularly valuable for third-world countries where native crops, typically destroyed by out-of-control pests, are struggling. These genetically modified crops provide an affordable solution for these regions, as large-scale pesticide projects require substantial capital investments they cannot afford.\n\nFurthermore, genetic manipulation has even allowed scientists to recreate certain plant species that have disappeared. For example, clover from the south of France, previously thought to have vanished, has been successfully brought back through genetic engineering. This showcases the potential for preserving biodiversity and reviving extinct plant species.\n\nThe notion that genetic engineering will create dinosaurs or other strange creatures is indeed living in a dream world driven by paranoia.

The chances of successfully recreating ancient organisms are incredibly slim, and the harmful aspects of genetic manipulation are few in number.

For instance, there could be unintended consequences like killing off other plant life or causing uncontrolled growth. However, these risks are minimal compared to the tremendous benefits offered by genetic engineering.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some potential risks, the positive impacts of genetic manipulation, such as the \"Stay-ripe\" tomato and disease-resistant crops, highlight its immense potential to revolutionize agriculture and improve global food security.

Through selective breeding, yeast strains have been developed to produce higher concentrations of alcohol.\n\nHowever, the manipulation of humans poses a more controversial aspect of genetics. Some argue whether it is beneficial to eradicate genetic diseases or detrimental to individuality. Concerns arise about people selecting desired traits for their children, potentially leading to a loss of uniqueness in appearance and ideas.\n\nMany people fear this prospect, viewing it as playing God and questioning if God intended for humans to manipulate genes. I believe that if God intended humans to develop the brain and capabilities necessary for such manipulation, He would have provided them.\n\nEradicating genetic diseases is a good idea, but it should not compromise individuality. Genetic warfare presents another ethical dilemma, with the potential creation of superhumans bred for strength, intuition, and toughness. Although we have been selectively training soldiers and engaging in muscle toning for years, the idea of genetically creating such beings raises significant concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while genetic manipulation can be a powerful tool for beneficial causes, it also holds the potential for misuse.

This renaisance period was an opportunity for Da Vinci and others to begin to understand the makings of the World around them, in a more logical and ordered way. In a way Da Vinci is a bad example, as he was not a scientist like you might find today, he was driven by many different things, art, mechanics etc. The difference was that in Da Vinci's day and in Faradays' the was so much unknown that any slight discovery would warrant investigation and the formulation of some rule or other.\n\tModern Scientists have much more information, and a greater technology to work that information into better use. Also there are far more scientists who can do this aswell. Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct an indepth study of a single subject and find out all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday there is less need to take everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, and I consider this a good thing, because how else would technology be updated. However this is not to say that I feel Scientists don't have or shouldn't have a certain curiosity about the unknown, or work is a wider field, but the fact that there are far more men discovering far less to uncover, suggests that some specialisation is the next logical step.\n\tAs far as schools and colleges are concerned I think it is very important to study as wide a field as is possible, because concentrating soley on one science closes so many other doors of discovery. Not to mention the fact that the sciences aid each other in understanding more easily and predicting the outcome.\n\tFor this reason I think combined courses are a very good thing. Not only do they create more of interest in science, in a more rounded sense, but also lay a firmer foundation for specialising at a later date.\n\tA combined course such as Biology and Chemistry opens doors to the likes of Biochemistry, genetic engineering and other professions which rely on a more informed background of science.

In Da Vinci's time, alongside Faraday's, even the smallest discovery warranted investigation and the formulation of new rules.\n\nIn contrast, modern scientists have access to much more information and advanced technology, making their work more focused and specialized. This shift suggests that a deeper, more focused study of a single subject is more beneficial than a broad interest in many fields. Modern scientists are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, ensuring continuous technological updates. However, this does not mean that curiosity or a broader field is irrelevant; rather, it indicates that specialization is a logical next step due to the sheer volume of existing knowledge.\n\nSchools and colleges play a crucial role in shaping the future of science.

The babies produced are often refered to as a 'test tube baby' because they were concieved in a testtube and not in a uterus.\nThere are two ways in which the process can be performed. The first case is if the ovum comes from the 'mother to be', this is usually because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile; if he is infertile a donor's sperm will be used instead. The second case is when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, it is then that a donor's ovum would be used. It is possible that IVF would be used in a case where both these scenarios are combined ie both partners are infertile, although I suspect this may be considered unethical and full of problems.\n\tThis process is full of ethical questions and the rights of all parties, the parents', the donor's and the child's, must be thought out before hand.\nFirstly the rights of the parents; there are two opinions 1) that people should have the right to have children if they want to and if it is possible to give them that chance, they should have it. 2) that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God. Problems may arise if the women was post-menopausal. Should she really be allowed to have children when her body has told ner no?

The babies produced through this method are often referred to as 'test tube babies' because they were conceived in a test tube and not in a uterus.\n\nThere are two primary ways in which the process can be performed. The first case involves using the ovum from the 'mother to be,' typically because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile. If the partner is infertile, a donor's sperm will be used instead. The second case occurs when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, in which case a donor's ovum would be utilized. It is also possible that IVF might be used in scenarios where both partners are infertile, although this could be considered unethical and fraught with problems.\n\nThe IVF process raises numerous ethical questions, particularly concerning the rights of all parties involved\u2014the parents, the donor, and the child. First and foremost, the rights of the parents must be considered. There are two prevailing opinions: one argues that people should have the right to have children if they want it and if it is possible to provide that opportunity. The other opinion contends that medical professionals should not have the right to play God. This debate becomes particularly complex in cases where the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal. Should she be allowed to have children despite her body indicating otherwise? Additionally, parents who underwent IVF later in life might face difficulties in later years, both physically and mentally, as they age and their child continues to grow. To address these potential issues, regulations must be carefully considered. Couples undergoing IVF are given the chance of having a child they wouldn't have otherwise, unlike adoption, which is typically not an option due to age constraints. Therefore, an age limit should be established, and family history should be thoroughly examined in the regulations. Another significant issue pertains to sex selection and its implications for the rights of the parents.

The egg can be that of the mother, in the case of blocked fallopian tubes or post-fertility treatment, but is often donated or even taken from an aborted foetus.

It is the whole purpose of our species, in some peoples' view, to reproduce and this discovery has given this opportunity to many more women. However, in respons to this, many people see it as going against nature.

This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today.

This shows the need for a human perception of a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one. However, the employment of labour saving devices can be seen as being something that frees the human brain and allows it to contemplate \"higher things\". This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, and indeed it is necessary, to learn more. This is because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is being reduced by the ability to employ machinery.\nThe computer has also served to make the brain redundant, or unused, by the advent of entertainment systems. The almost universal fanaticism of the young, it is also widespread amongst the supposedly more learned adults, for games has led to less employment of the brain. Unless it is to learn to get past level five, a necessary skill for life. This prevents the traditional learning process and wastes time and energy that could be better applied.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the computer, while undeniably useful, still necessitates a human brain to guide its operations.

Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people from eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.\nPeople eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear for their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone and boil them up to produce offal. Hey presto, instant animal feed. Never mind the fact that cows are herbivores, and knowing better than thousands of years of evolution, this practice has been widespread since the 1980's.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There have always been various reasons for people choosing not to eat beef or meat in general.

As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu. An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant. An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There has been a significant scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), which could potentially lead to the human equivalent of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). BSE, a disease that affects cows' brains and spiral tissue (or offal), has been linked to cases of CJD after a few incidents. Researchers believe that consuming beef containing offal could transmit this fatal disease to humans.\n\nThis alarming claim has devastated the British beef industry, as people are now too fearful to consume beef due to the risk of contracting the illness. As a result, beef sales in America have dropped by 15%, while sales in Britain have decreased by approximately 6%-7%. Although scientists indicate that contracting CJD requires the cow's offal to be present within the beef, customers remain hesitant to eat the meat, fearing it might come from a butcher cutting costs. This fear significantly impacted sales in fast food restaurants, where beefburgers are a popular menu item. For instance, McDonald's immediately responded by announcing that their beefburgers are made from 100% pure beef and contain no offal.\n\nIn my view, no reputable restaurant would risk buying inferior beef, as they could face legal consequences if a customer contracted CJD and traced it back to the establishment. Such an outcome could lead to severe financial and operational repercussions, possibly forcing the restaurant to shut down and sell its assets.\n\nThe drop in beef sales has not only affected restaurants but also caused a broader impact on the British economy. The beef industry, once a vital part of the country's agricultural sector, now struggles to regain consumer trust and stabilize its market position in light of the BSE scare. The fear surrounding beef consumption has led to increased scrutiny and stricter regulations, aiming to prevent similar outbreaks in the future and restore confidence among consumers.", "speed": 0.3829489840348685, "eta": "00h01m26s"}
