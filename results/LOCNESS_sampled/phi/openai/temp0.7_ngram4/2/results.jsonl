All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula.

Before the Ev\u00e8nements of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and ruled to closely from Paris. After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff. However, universities were often divided into new universities according to the political leanings of its professors, and have been held back by political squabbles.

However, the dropout rate is incredibly high, about 57%, so many waste a year and undergo great emotional and financial stress. Before the events of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and heavily influenced by Paris. After 1968, Edgar Faure attempted to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry remained responsible for building costs, universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in choosing academic staff. However, universities often divided into new institutions according to the political leanings of their professors, and have been held back by political squabbles. The university graduate does not enjoy the same prestige as his European counterparts. Universities have little contact with the outside business world, and the divided nature of the UERs allows little scope for cross-fertilization of disciplines. A license does not automatically guarantee a good job, and a \"jeune diplom\u00e9\" could quite easily find himself working in a supermarket checkout. Many students, therefore, wonder if it is worth the strain of the French university, which does not guarantee any future.\n\nWhen it comes to top jobs, the ex-students of the \"Grandes Ecoles\" will always be top priority. Described by \"The Guardian\" as \"The Cadre de la Cream,\" these schools train an elite for future top careers in administration, industry, and government. Two-thirds of the top hundred French firms have directors who are ex-graduates of these schools. The privileged graduates of these schools can guarantee a high-ranking career and accelerated promotion.", "speed": 0.5803636720126466, "eta": "00h11m03s"}

It was a compromise between the Gaullists and other political forces. Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was practiced and preached by his predecessors.

However, this function has been usurped by the President, along with certain other functions.\n\nGiscard d'Estaing, when asked what the Prime Minister's role was, replied that the Prime Minister is in charge of contingency problems, while the President is in charge of what is permanent and essential.

For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor.

Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers.

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticize this philosophy. In Candide, the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-ten-Tronckh.\n\nThe whole book is a criticism of 'l'optimisme.' For example, when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army, he is beaten almost to death but does not concern himself because he knows it is for his own good\u2014indeed, later in the book, he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this might seem like good training, it is not because of this that he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop, without hesitation, and then proceeds to kill his sweetheart's brother.\n\nVoltaire shows his dislike of 'l'optimisme' when Pangloss, Candide, and James are caught in a bad storm at sea, in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors: Candide, Pangloss, and a sailor. The storm is caused by an earthquake that destroys the city to which Candide was sailing. On arrival, they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer, but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\nCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be skeptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this, especially as the reason he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book, we begin to see how Candide is gradually led away from 'l'optimisme,' or perhaps more importantly, how 'l'optimisme' is shown to be the philosophy of despair. The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters.", "speed": 0.5803636720126466, "eta": "00h11m03s"}

Various themes are prevalent throughout the book. One of the most dominant being that of Optimism.\n\tThe idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches his philosophy at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind.

Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people.

The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three.

Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body.

Weary of invasion or interference from outside, this type of mentality can be seen amongst the British even today. Therefore, when discussing the idea of a single Europe, the British feel under threat.\n\tAs the year 1992 comes closer, \"a new pawn for Europe\", there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding what will actually happen. In Britain, there has been little emphasis on the involvement for everybody in a single Europe. Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers even, but not really, the average person on the street.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. But the extent to which this happen depends on the role and the power of the european Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps, a single currency, so this of course would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an \"advisory committee\" for the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc, will be seen as merely an extension of the E.E.C. and nothing more.

Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers, but not really, the average person on the street.\n\nIn my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. The extent to which this happens depends on the role and the power of the European Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps a single currency, so this would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an \"advisory committee\" for the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc., will be seen as merely an extension of the EEC and nothing more. But if the majority of legislation were to come from Brussels, then I think the British would feel a great loss of sovereignty and even resentment.\n\nObviously, a united Europe is not going to erase centuries of culture to form one identifiable \"European culture\"; but this might always be a worry for the British (and probably, for other countries too). Thus, a loss of power for the British Parliament would probably be seen as the first step of this \"merging together.\" Nevertheless, one should not forget the role of the citizens. If they do not want to \"become European,\" then they will not. They would have to respect the European Parliament, but in every other way life could carry on as normal. It goes without saying that they would want to take advantage of, say, better trade agreements between countries, cheaper holidays, etc., but I cannot envisage a mass exodus across the Channel.", "speed": 0.5535356633224126, "eta": "00h09m39s"}

Any powers granted to a European government will surely have to be offset by a loss to national government.\n\tThe European Monetary System for example provides a more rigid structure for Europe than individual governments will have been used to. To a certain extent, this system takes the instruments of monetary policy out of the hands of national government. It cannot for example devalue its currency beyond a certain narrow band, as it may have done before when attempting to improve domestic industries competitiveness, faced with international competition.\n\tThe loss of customs barriers within Europe in 1992 will, in the eyes of many people, threaten Britain's sovereignty. Internal barriers will be removed in favour of a common barrier to protect Europe as a whole. Doubts have already been cast on some countries'ability to prevent for example illegal immigration and drug trafficking. This form of unification will affect Britain especially, since Britain's position in Europe has always been made slightly different by the fact that it is an island.

Any powers granted to a European government will surely have to be offset by a loss to national governments.\n\nThe European Monetary System, for example, provides a more rigid structure for Europe than individual governments have been used to. To a certain extent, this system takes the instruments of monetary policy out of the hands of national governments. It, for instance, cannot devalue its currency beyond a certain narrow band, as it may have done before when attempting to improve domestic industries' competitiveness, faced with international competition.\n\nThe loss of customs barriers within Europe in 1992 will, in the eyes of many people, threaten Britain's sovereignty. Internal barriers will be removed in favor of a common barrier to protect Europe as a whole. Doubts have already been cast on some countries' ability to prevent, for example, illegal immigration and drug trafficking. This form of unification will affect Britain especially, since Britain's position in Europe has always been made slightly different by the fact that it is an island.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up.

People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable.

Drugs for many diseases, like Dilantin for the treatment of seizures caused by epilepsy, have increased the quality of life for several people. Drugs have promoted the longevity of many patients who otherwise wouldn't have lived otherwise. People victimized by cancer and AIDS have long depended upon Depo-Provera and AZT for their therapeutic value. The miracles of modern biochemical research have dramatically changed the way we treat disease. However, drug companies have escalated their prices over 82 percent in the decade of the 1980s, making a crunch in the pocketbooks of many Americans, including pharmacies and drug buyers, who finally sued to get their fair share of discounts. Blatant overpricing of many important drugs has drastically declined the quality of healthcare among many Americans, especially the elderly and people with fixed incomes. This is why federal intervention is necessary with the establishment of a price regulation review board to stop the skyrocketing of already outrageous prices.\n\nHealth care statistics on expenditures alone are mindboggling. The pharmaceutical industry argues that the cost of drugs used outside hospitals was $36.4 billion in 1991, only five percent of the total national health costs (a whopping $751.8 billion). That sounds like a nice picture. However, these statistics are flawed because 55 percent of what American consumers paid for healthcare was directly out of pocket, mostly because Americans were getting prescriptions outside of hospitals. This price-gouging shows in high hospital bills, which is another factor to consider.\n\nEven though the pharmaceutical industry argues that medical pricing boards would raise prices and eliminate competition between companies, actually the opposite seems to be true. As a result of having medical price boards in other countries, for example, drugs are sold at rates substantially cheaper than in the United States. In Canada, where the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board was established, prices of drugs by Canadian subsidiaries of American companies are substantially lower, averaging 32%. Similar lower rates also happen in European subsidiaries, where rates are anywhere from 74 to 45 percent lower than in the United States.

It is these ethics that\ncontribute to the majority of our decision making tactics. When forming\na decision, based on ethics, we must be careful to determine which side\nis morally correct.\nA dilemma in which morals have come up more often than not is the case\nfor animal rights.

Some of them are easily justified, and some are not. These dilemmas can range from a simple act of choosing which friends side to take in a disagreement, or something more serious, like a priest giving up his reconciliation oath and handing over a confidential confession of a murderer to the police. We make most of these decisions based on our values and beliefs. One's values and beliefs tend to stem from their religious background or the morals and ethics on which they were raised. It is these ethics that contribute to the majority of our decision-making tactics. When forming a decision based on ethics, we must be careful to determine which side is morally correct.\n\nA dilemma in which morals often come up is the case for animal rights. Should these animals be tested for the protection of human lives, or more importantly, what gives us the right to test these animals? Now, in the Bible, it says that humans were to have dominion over. What better authority figure than God could give us this right? Animals were put on Earth for humans to do with as they please, as long as we do not take advantage of this gift. I believe animal testing in most cases is trying to save people's lives, one way or another. The decision must be made that a human's life is more important than an animal's life. Animal testing is a crucial part of our society and must go on if humans want to continue as the superior species.\n\nAn example of this is a three-year-old named Timmy Baker who has a heart attack from a disease he possibly contracted from eating an undercooked hamburger.

However, access should be restricted to exclude any and all devices which could endanger the security or safety of the people involved. This argument is often debated around times when the death penalty is actually put into effect. One such case that received national attention was in California.\n\nRobert Alton Harris was sentenced to death in 1979 for the kidnapping and murder of two San Diego teenagers. He was on parole after having served three years for manslaughter when this happened. After an enormous number of appeals, Harris was finally executed in the gas chamber on the morning of April 21, 1992, shortly after 6 a.m. Harris was the first person to be executed in California since 1967.\n\nOriginally, San Quentin warden Daniel Vasquez had banned all media coverage of the execution. In a press release, Vasquez reasoned that the execution would be a highly sensitive event and that unrestricted media coverage could compromise the safety and security of those involved. However, San Francisco public television channel KQED filed a lawsuit opposing the ban because they were working on a documentary about Harris and wanted to film the execution. Over two dozen newspapers and broadcast stations joined KQED in protesting the ban. Some of these groups included the American Newspaper Publishers Association, California Newspaper Publishers Association, California First Amendment Coalition, National Press Photographers Association, and the Radio and Television News Directors Association of Southern California. The media groups filed a brief in U.S. District Court asking that the ban be canceled on the grounds that it would hinder their ability to inform the public about the execution.\n\nJudge Robert H.

We find it surprising, perhaps even shocking, when someone dies from anything other than old age. We expect that when we get sick, the doctor will make us better. The doctor's own Hippocratic Oath lends itself to the preservation of life at what appears to be any cost, a cost that threatens the economy and forces discussions of both health care and insurance for the care we are increasingly coming to expect as a right. We focus our discussions on money rather than on our assumptions about the value of life. Life is considered unquestionable, but I would like to give it more scrutiny. The medical community derives its existence solely on the preservation of life, resulting in diagnostic methods to identify individuals that are predisposed to particular diseases and treatment practices focusing on the symptoms of those sick individuals rather than seeking answers to eliminate the causes of these diseases. Examples of diseases where the primary focus is the treatment of symptoms to artificially postpone death include Cancer, AIDS, and Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD).", "speed": 0.5609604450699233, "eta": "00h08m35s"}

This is a different concept altogether. The desire for what we may not have can at times cause people to conduct themselves in a way that they might not otherwise do. Although there is a healthy desire to meet the needs that we have, at times this desire can be pushed to an extreme.\n\nHow many times have we seen on the evening news a family being broken apart, a company going under, or even a nation crumbling simply because there was a desperate desire, on the part of one or many, for something that exceeds what was actually needed or required? Even individuals can be destroyed who are in constant search of what evades them. They think that having the \"right\" car, living in the \"right\" neighborhood, or knowing the \"right\" people can bring them happiness or contentment. This love of money urges them on, causes them to neglect their families, and at times to commit crimes for which they are imprisoned. Our society pays dearly, both financially and socially, for their love affair with money.\n\nIt is a cross-cultural thing. We can be speaking of the American dollar, the Japanese yen, or the Spanish peseta. The love of whatever represents the financial exchange between parties wreaks havoc in a nation, a family, and even an individual life.\n\nNot the money itself, but rather the love of it persuades men's hearts, captivates their minds, and influences their priorities and their behavior. The hoarding of wealth for personal benefit or security, when pushed to an extreme, is the root of all evil.\n\nIt produces selfishness in even the smallest child. It's not long before a 4-5-year-old realizes the power that money brings. He begins to hide it, save it, ask for it, and spend it.\n\nA healthy thing can be turned into a tool for disaster. Is money the root of all evil? No.", "speed": 0.539023539157225, "eta": "00h07m56s"}

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims.

However, feminists have not always considered the diverse perspectives and desires of all women. Some women were content with traditional roles, while others sought more opportunities. The result is that all women are expected to conform to the rules set by these feminists, which can be challenging. For example, during the Iraq war, feminists argued for allowing women to serve in combat positions. This stance was controversial, with some believing that women are not as physically capable for such roles and could be at risk. On the other hand, some women are pleased that the current rules remain unchanged.\n\nFeminists have also highlighted issues of unfair promotions and sexual harassment in the workplace.

(The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent with each other.)", "speed": 0.539023539157225, "eta": "00h07m56s"}

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00.

The program name was also changed to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).\n\nIn 1967, the Work Incentive Program (WIN) was established to provide job training and counseling services. These services recognized that welfare families had special social and psychological difficulties. Child-care efforts were also expanded. Plus, \"job developers\" were attached to WIN offices to locate appropriate positions for WIN graduates.\n\nFurther reforms occurred in 1971. Under the Talmadge Amendments, WIN offices were required to spend at least one-third of their funds for on-the-job training or public-service employment. The new theory was that placement in these components would improve the chances of participants obtaining regular jobs at the end of their assignments. It was also believed that welfare recipients lacked motivation to enter the workforce and needed to be pushed into it.\n\nNevertheless, none of the past or present reforms of welfare policy have succeeded in lowering the number of welfare recipients in the United States. Since its beginning, AFDC has undergone a major transformation in its size, cost, and clientele.", "speed": 0.539023539157225, "eta": "00h07m56s"}

Once \"soft lenses\" were introduced to the public, the \"lense craze\" caught rapidly and hasn't died down yet. I got my first pair of contact lenses when I was fourteen years old.\n\nI had been wearing glasses since the time I was ten and was tired of being limited in certain athletic activities because of my sight. At the time, I played basketball; if I wore my glasses, they would end up on the floor, and if I didn't wear them, I'd be more or less \"blind.\" Also, I enjoyed swimming\u2014even though I could hardly see far enough in front of me to see where I was headed! After my eyes adjusted to the initial \"sting\" when I inserted my first pair of lenses, I knew that my glasses would be placed in my desk drawer and stay there.\n\nAbout two years ago, another type of lenses were made accessible to the public. They're called \"disposables\" and I can't even begin to explain what a difference they make. You can wear them for a week and then throw them away\u2014with no worries about cleaning them and taking them out every night before going to sleep. It's such a great feeling to wake up in the morning, open your eyes, and be able to see perfectly!", "speed": 0.5516687578056008, "eta": "00h06m47s"}

As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.

At night, one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded. Radio, hence, gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the newsmaking process. Newspapers had been around for many years, but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident. Radio gives the ability to reach many more people instantly.\n\nAs a form of entertainment, radio and its most important and now more common offshoot, television, have changed people's lives. A typical day for a child in today's world consists of going to school and coming home to watch TV. There have even been forms of entertainment, such as video games, made for this other form of entertainment. Nowadays, everybody watches TV.\n\nFor example, my se\u00f1ora is over 100 years old, and for her, TV is the greatest thing in the world. She sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy. Television offers soap operas, game shows, sit-coms, sporting events, movies, and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day.\n\nIn short, I don't know what life was like before radio, but its invention has changed the way we see and do things.", "speed": 0.5609372915112774, "eta": "00h05m44s"}

This establishment of gender identity should begin at the earliest age possible.  Masters and Johnson say children begin to recognize gender roles by age three. (548) Children should be taught that there is a core of behavior that makes them boys or girls but, there are other types of behavior that is open to change.  The message children are given now is a stereotype that has been the root of many problems they encounter later in life.  Men and women today need to understand and respect the fact that they are different.  They communicate in different styles.  This difference is what makes life exciting.  Gender roles, like relationships, must remain dynamic.  People must know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.\nTo achieve a well adjusted, gender relazed, adulthood society must ammend the method and the message we are giving our children.  Katha Pollit does an excellent job of illustrating how television, one of the more influential sources for children, is giving kids a skewed start in shaping their ideas of what's important in being a boy or a girl.  In her essay \"The Smurfette Principle\", she cites. many painful examples of how little ones receive a terribly distorted picture of gender roles.  Although the method takes on many forms, the message is the same <*>.\n \tPollit pints out that even the more enlightened Public Broadca stations engage in male gender bias.\nStarting girls into life's roller coaster ride with the idea that boys lives are more important than their's is a tremendous disadvantage.  It's a bad message delivered at a bad time through a bad medium.  Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur.  Parents allow their kids to watch these cartoons for two reasons; first, because they watched them when they were kids and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet.  It is important to note that these bad signals have an adverse effect on boys as well as girls.  Pollit contends:that the message is more straight forward for the boys. <|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In a constantly changing world, it is important for both genders to have a firm grasp on what it means to be a man or a woman.

People must know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.\n\nTo achieve a well-adjusted, gender-relaxed adulthood society, we must amend the method and the message we are giving our children. Katha Pollit does an excellent job of illustrating how television, one of the more influential sources for children, is giving kids a skewed start in shaping their ideas of what's important in being a boy or a girl. In her essay \"The Smurfette Principle,\" she cites many painful examples of how little ones receive a terribly distorted picture of gender roles. Although the method takes on many forms, the message is the same: Pollit points out that even more enlightened public broadcasting stations engage in male gender bias.\n\nStarting girls into life's roller coaster ride with the idea that boys' lives are more important than their own is a tremendous disadvantage. It's a bad message delivered at a bad time through a bad medium. Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons, where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur. Parents allow their kids to watch these cartoons for two reasons: first, because they watched them when they were kids, and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet. It is important to note that these bad signals have an adverse effect on boys as well as girls. Pollit contends that the message is more straightforward for the boys.", "speed": 0.5609372915112774, "eta": "00h05m44s"}

I had a teacher in high school who would stay after school for as long as a student needed her to help him with something unclear. High school teachers deserve the most recognition because students in high school seem to be the hardest to deal with in a classroom.\n\nTeachers should be appreciated because they make a difference in almost every child's life. I know that my favorite teacher from high school made a difference in my life. She was more like my mother at school than a teacher. If I needed something, such as a safety pin or advice, I could depend on her for whatever I needed. Teachers seem to have a mother instinct even if they are not real mothers. Teachers leave their homes to come and educate the children of others. They too deserve their flowers while they live just as many mothers ask of their children. I've heard that if you ask a child who they admire, many answer with the name of a teacher.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, people have been rewarded when they do good, so why aren't teachers rewarded when they do good? People don't realize the good that teachers do.\n\nTeachers continue to educate even when students don't want to learn. Teaching is not only their job, it becomes their responsibility. The reward can be big or small. A material gift or a kind word of expression. The type of reward isn't as important as the fact of giving the reward because teachers deserve it.\n\nAfter going to school for twelve years, I've found that I respected my high school teachers more than I did any teacher before high school. I'm guilty of being like society and not rewarding teachers whom I didn't like. Those teachers still deserve reward because they are still educators. High school teachers seem to be more dedicated to teaching.", "speed": 0.5609372915112774, "eta": "00h05m44s"}

There are many reasons why there should be a salary cap. For one, most of the professional football players make more money than a college graduate does. Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime.

Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own.

One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past.

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nViolence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer. With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily, the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern. Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations (Hepburn 1). Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent. Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime, psychotic murderers, police cases, emergency services, international terrorism, and war (Hepburn 1). Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children.\nThe V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows. Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show.

With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily, the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern. Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations (Hepburn 1). Many children watch violent TV shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent. Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime, psychotic murderers, police cases, emergency services, international terrorism, and war (Hepburn 1). Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children.\n\nThe V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows. Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\n\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy.\" The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\n\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show.

If a person chooses to do whatever in their room, however long they want to should be between that person and their roommate. One evening I started my homework late. A male classmate came to help me, but we didn't finish the homework. He had to leave my room at 2 a.m. We went to the lobby, but one girl was talking so loud I couldn't hear myself think. Another was playing the piano at 2 a.m. Why? I felt this was rude. Besides, other residents were sleeping.\n\nHomecoming weekend, surprisingly, my cousin came to visit some friends and me. He spent most of the day with his friends. I caught up with him later that night. He walked me to my dorm and spent a little time with me, but 2 a.m. struck, and he had to go. We talked some more in the lobby, but we had to keep our voices down out of respect. I wanted him to spend the night because he's in the military, and I'm not going to see him for three years. He's stationed in Germany. This is another reason we need overnight visitation. Relatives should be able to chill out with us in our rooms. They should know how we are living here at U.S.C.", "speed": 0.5448457384363232, "eta": "00h04m55s"}

If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention.

They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it.

If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also.

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been around since the sixties, and people today are realizing that it is certainly an issue that will not go away. It seems that nowadays the use of marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently, many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding marijuana.

These sites are also very common in major American cities and, at times, in London.\n\nWith such a large number of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. The government alone spends billions of pounds trying to keep the UK roads in as good a condition as possible.\n\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with the number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress, which can again be due to traffic congestion.\n\nAll of these problems, one way or another, can all be linked with congestion and hence the number of cars on the road.

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nOn Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic. The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train.

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without holds-up and traffic jams. To remedy this, the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improved, there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident, and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy solution to this mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e., the railways. People are not taking to the rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privatisation of different areas.

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nThere have been many demonstrations by activists when fox hunting is taking place and although I do not agree with some of the animal activists methods I am in this case of the strong opinion that fox hunting should be banned in the United Kingdom. My reasons for this are as follows.\nFox hunting in my eyes is a brutal sport carried out by the higher classes in society. It is regarded by many people as being traditional and indeed the practice of fox hunting has been carried out for many years. However I regard fox hunting as a pointless and futile sport. In many ways it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have be necessary to cull the numbers of foxes but now foxes have become so rare that they are rarely seen in the wild.\nFoxes are simply hunted for fun and for trohpy's. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests and occasionaly foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats but now public opinion has put this to an end. \nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population.

My reasons for this are as follows.\n\nFox hunting, in my eyes, is a brutal sport carried out by the higher classes in society. It is regarded by many people as being traditional, and indeed, the practice of fox hunting has been carried out for many years. However, I regard fox hunting as a pointless and futile sport. In many ways, it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have been necessary to cull the numbers of foxes, but now foxes have become so rare that they are rarely seen in the wild.\n\nFoxes are simply hunted for fun and trophies. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests, and occasionally, foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However, this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young, and it is only rarely that foxes seize the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this, many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals, this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were once widely sought after for the making of fur coats, but now public opinion has put this to an end.\n\nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved, as well as dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting, it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population. The foxes are not really given a chance. Once one is spotted by the hunting party, a pack of hounds is sent after it. All the fox can do is flee in desperation. It does not really stand a chance against the overwhelming odds of about twenty blood-thirsty hounds.

If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life.

Recently, they began a subscription to view Tyson's \"next Live Lights.\" This member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either.\n\nNow let us consider the friends or family of a boxer who has been permanently injured (or killed due to a fight). These individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport. The family, who were originally against their son finishing college early to take up the sport, are likely leading the protests against boxing.\n\nHow pleased, proud, and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world, yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career. This hypocritical view is pushed by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the foreseeable future.", "speed": 0.5150657102307846, "eta": "00h03m08s"}

The goverment claim that it will not effect humans and the tabloids argue it will effect us if we eat it. The recent experiment on mice which supposidly proved that there is no link between B.S.E and the human equivalent was not seen as good evidence for the campaign by the Goverment.\nIf the papers keep plugging away, saying \"beef is bad for you\", the people will slowly stop eating beef and choose a suitable replacement, for example lamb. It is in my view therefore that it is press blowing the situation out of all proportions that will be the down fall of beef in the U.K. It was not long ago that the press anounced a killer bug eating people alive, thus catching the attention of the U.K. When the press got bored of this story, the bug dissappeared and with it peoples worries about its effects.

Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in World War II again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentration camps and saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sense of immediacy in the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.\n\nThis is all very interesting, you may say, but these geneticists must still feel some moral obligation. The actual work of genetic engineering is constantly coming up for discussion in today's media world, and the work of many leading laboratories has been recognized as useful. For example, the production of insulin by genetic engineering is undoubtedly a laudable use of scientific knowledge. Another example is the production of high-yield crops for third-world countries, another useful facet of genetic control. But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound? For example, the high-yield crops give many times the harvest of a normal variety yet leach the soil, require very careful use of oil-based fertilizers, and require countless other minor adjustments. Are these plants morally reprehensible because they require greater care and nurturing than their hardier cousins?", "speed": 0.5787711388881018, "eta": "00h00m57s"}

This could be harnessed especially in the cattle and dairy industry, where a farmer needs specifically male or female cattle, and so waste could be reduced.\n\nThere are also future possibilities of being able to decide on specific features for offspring, such as hair color or musical talent. This has, in some ways, been carried out for centuries by cross-breeding to obtain desired features. Carrying it out genetically would give more control. Genetic manipulation of viruses could mean that they could be used to carry useful genetic information around the body and impregnate it into other cells.\n\nMany moral problems are raised with such advances. Do we have the right to play God? Should we be able to choose features of our children? More importantly, then is the question of whether it is right to deprive a child of life because of genetic defects, which is likely to raise the most arguments.\n\nAlong with the moral problems, there are also physical dangers with \"tampering\" with genetics. We are using bacteria and viruses to find vaccinations and cures, but there is a possibility that \"super\" viruses or bacteria could be produced, which our bodies could not defend against and could wipe out entire populations. There is the chance that this is done purposefully, as biological warfare, with catastrophic effects.\n\nThe moral argument is difficult, as who, at the end of the day, has the right to make a decision? What about medical uses already in practice, such as the production of insulin for diabetics, which has been made possible by genetic advancements? Very few people would argue that there is a moral problem with that; so where is the line drawn?\n\nIt is an argument that will reappear and become more fierce as each new genetic step forward is discovered.", "speed": 0.5787711388881018, "eta": "00h00m57s"}

There are debates about whether it will rid the world of genetic diseases, which would be good, or whether it could lead to negative consequences. Many people argue that it is wrong and that we are playing God. They fear that individuals may select the traits they want for their children, eliminating personal faults and imperfections and making everyone look and think the same.\n\nThis is what most people are scared of, which is why they believe it is playing God.

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nHow far and in what ways has the human brain been made redundant by the invention of the computer?\nThe invention of the computer, however useful, still requires a human brain to instruct it what to do. This shows the need for a human perception of a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one.

{"text_index": 384, "prompt": "<|user|>Correct grammar, spelling, and any awkward sentence constructions in the following essay. Keep the original voice and tone. Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nPeople in the UK may be put off eating beef because of the mad cow disease scares that are going around in the news reports. Little is known about the effects this disease can have, on humans if there is any. The public are not aware if the meat they are/were eating is contaminated or not. If it is then will it affect them? It may affect them but only in the long term or it may be irradiated in the cooking process. Too little is known at this stage due to the relatively recent introduction of BSE.\nIf the market for beef drops in the UK then there could be a drastic effect on agriculture as a whole. If people stop eating beef then there will be a surplus of cows in the UK. They will have to be slaughtered and be wasted, if they cannot be sold abroad. Veal is sold abroad, so as long as the foreigners are not afraid of BSE then so can beef.\nIf people did not eat beef then it would be likely they would stop eating anything associated with beef (eg milk and therefore cheese.) all dairy product sales would decrease, farmers would go bust, products would be wasted and the farmers would be after sane subsidies. Food would have to be imported thus replacing our own state of 'autarky' and costing the government money. Farmers would have to get rid of their stock at great expense and try and farm something else which would be suited to their land and area. A beef substitute would be created.\nThe government would be forced to carry out more extensive checks on beef and especially beef from 'mad cows'. The Ministry of Agriculture would be expected to clarify once and for all whether it was safe or not and then prove it to try and get people to eat beef again before it became too late. Extensive advertisement campaigns would be used by the government to get people to eat beef, but with a women dying and the doctors saying she died of mad cow disease, it doesnot help.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "People in the UK may be put off eating beef due to the mad cow disease scares that are circulating in the news.
