In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is a characteristic that often accompanies duplicity.

In an attempt to revolt against the absurdity of life, individuals often engage in duplicity, refusing to accept life's inherent absurdity.\n\n\"La Chute\" explores various types of guilt assigned to different characters. Clarence's guilt, for instance, is multifaceted. As a lawyer in Paris, his previous life was marked by a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. However, once he hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers memories of his past, Clarence realizes that this life was indeed duplicitous. His earlier image in the mirror now appears double to him because he failed to recognize the essential nature of the human condition, leading a life that superficially appeared altruistic but was, in reality, driven by a desire for control over others.\n\nIn an effort to overcome this guilt, Clarence attempts to overtly demonstrate his double character by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Despite these efforts, he remains unable to rid himself of his guilt. Consequently, he travels to Amsterdam, a place associated with Nazi atrocities, to perform his newly created role as 'juge-p\u00e9nitent.' In this role, he aims to exorcize his guilt by exposing it to others and regaining a sense of superiority he lost. He wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, not for punishment, but to regain his self-esteem through the act of judging others.\n\nTo vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall,' Clarence references a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated.

Man's mortality is now painfully clear to him, as is the futility of his life.

However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith.

During an everyday task, the meaning of the act is suddenly withdrawn, making the futility of the action overwhelmingly apparent.

When life is stripped of the meaning we usually attribute to it, every act appears futile. Camus eloquently describes this solitude and isolation as akin to a light that doesn't shine.\n\nHaving grasped the absurdity of life, Camus notes that some people attempt to deny it by taking a leap of faith, often seeking refuge in religion.

It is innocent as he has no past experience. He believes that people are predestined: <quote>. To Sartre there is no predestination as we control our destiny by the choices we take.

Furthermore he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.\nOreste therefore starts off in a position of bad faith and moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticiy with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). This transformation is symbolised by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste her brother and not Phil\u00e8be. What primarily inflences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play.

All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula. Our own values and emotions play a large role in this right from the start when Caligula  is thought to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla. This grief although incorrectly perceived by his courtiers, perhaps makes us feel sympathy for Caligula. When his patriciens think that the young Emperor is ill or mentally disturbed we may feel sympathy for him if we areselves do not like being unwell.\nCaligula is based on Camus' theme of the absurd, which is according to Ad\u00e8le King \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires\". From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of human existence. He murders indiscriminantly, causes famine and even kills his own lover. What man wants is to be immortal and happy, something which, with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula knows is impossible. However Caligula revolts against the absurd by trying to achieve the impossible so that <quote>. The symbol of this impossibility is the moon. Caligula thinks that if he can have the moon he will be above the gods and in charge of an empire where the impossible is king. Caligula therefore decides to be destiny - <quote>. He wants to show his people the one truth he has - that <quote>. He sets out to show them their immortality and their sadness by killing them. To a certain extent Camus manages to evoke sympathy and admiration for Caligula in that the Emperor wants to share the truth he has found about the world with his people. He wants to help them understand for their own good. He wants to make them aware of the absurd, as he is, so that they can then go on to live quantatively and intensly.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In \"Caligula,\" the story unfolds through the interactions of its characters, each with their own negative or positive valuation that either evokes sympathy for Caligula or challenges the audience's perception of him. Caligula remains the sole focus of attention throughout the play, and it is his actions, thoughts, and words that drive the narrative. This focalization ultimately leaves it to the reader or audience to decide whether they harbor any sympathy or admiration for Caligula, with our own values and emotions playing a significant role from the beginning. Caligula's mourning for his sister Drusilla, though mistakenly perceived by his courtiers, may elicit sympathy for him. When his patricians think he is ill or mentally disturbed, the audience may also feel sympathy for Caligula, especially if they themselves do not like being unwell.\n\nCaligula's character embodies Camus' theme of the absurd, as Ad\u00e8le King describes it: \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires.\" From Drusilla's death until his own, Caligula becomes acutely aware of the mortality of human beings, feeling the futility of human existence. He murders indiscriminately, causes famine, and even kills his own lover. Man desires immortality and happiness, but with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula understands that such goals are impossible. Yet, in a revolt against the absurd, Caligula attempts to achieve the impossible, believing that if he can possess the moon, he will transcend the gods and reign over an empire where the impossible is paramount. Caligula thus decides to be destiny, seeking to show his people the one truth he has discovered: that life is inherently absurd. He aims to make them aware of their mortality and sadness by instilling in them his understanding of the absurd, hoping they can live quantitatively and intensely, as he does.\n\nIn this way, Camus manages to evoke both sympathy and admiration for Caligula. The Emperor desires to share his profound truth with his people, wanting them to understand for their own good. Caligula believes in making his people aware of the absurd so they can live fully, mirroring his own existential realization. Through his actions and intentions, Caligula becomes a complex figure, simultaneously tragic and heroic, challenging the audience to grapple with the profound implications of his philosophy.", "speed": 0.5526527581736748, "eta": "00h11m36s"}

Provide only the final essay.\n\nIn the play 'Caligula' Camus is dealing with the themes of death and the absurd, and throughout the play we can see different characters reacting in different ways. They also however interact with each other, making the arguments of the other more credible or maybe discounting other's arguments and thus swaying the audience to one side. It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him - <quote>. Shocked that it is not for his sister that he mourns but the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.\nHe announces that he wants \"la lune\" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but to other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too. We see that he is searching for something out of reach, and we have sympathy knowing that the moon is impossible. Camus explores this theme in Le Mythe de Sisyphe where he says thant man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, onnes with nature, and innocence, but instead recieves lies, disorder, and a separation of man and nature ending in death not immortality - and warns <quote>. The audience knows that the moon is not <quote> and takes pity.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In Camus's play 'Caligula,' he explores the themes of death and the absurd, revealing various characters' reactions and interactions, which either validate or undermine each other's arguments. This dynamic effectively sways the audience's sympathies, leading us to find ourselves strangely sympathetic to Caligula by the end of the play, despite his devastating deeds. By examining Caligula's words and those of others, we gain insight into this surprising conclusion.\n\nAt the play's outset, Drusilla, Caligula's sister, dies, eliciting a clear sense of sympathy from the audience for death and mourning. Yet, when we later learn that the 'death' revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to Caligula, we are taken aback. Shocked by his mourning for the state of the human condition rather than his sister, we begin to see the 'wider' truth he uncovers, finding him increasingly fascinating.\n\nCaligula's announcement of his desire for \"la lune\" initially appears ridiculous to the audience, but it is deemed perfectly acceptable by other characters in the play, such as H\u00e9licon, who agrees to help him in his quest. As we observe him searching for something ultimately unattainable, we, too, feel sympathy, knowing the moon's impossibility. Camus delves into this theme in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe,\" where he posits that humanity's quest for truth, understanding, clarity, and harmony with nature ultimately results in lies, disorder, and a rift between man and nature, culminating in death rather than immortality. Recognizing the moon's unattainability, the audience feels pity for Caligula's futile pursuit.\n\nThrough these moments, Camus underscores the absurdity of Caligula's quest and the broader human condition, allowing us to empathize with Caligula's tragic plight despite his horrific actions. By examining the interplay of character reactions and the unfolding narrative, we gain a deeper understanding of the themes of death and the absurd, culminating in our complex sympathy for Caligula.", "speed": 0.5526527581736748, "eta": "00h11m36s"}

If this is the case then all actions are equal, as nothing really matters. <quote>.\nMan is born free, according to Camus and he has the choice to be however he chooses and can change this way of living whenever he wishes. Camus was an athiest so he did not believe in any metaphysical power or fate which dictated how you should act. \nMan is always in search of knowledge & truth. He wants to be one with the world and understand it fully. This is not possible because, to understand something completely, you have to be fused with it, otherwise there will always have to be a leap of the mind. In scientific theory there is always a gap between experiments and their conclusion otherwise all theories would be the same. The only truth that we can be sure of is that we are mortal and will one day die. The awareness of the absurd may lead us to think that suicide would be a natural consequence of seeing the futility of life, but Camus doesn't believe that at all.

He argues that the realization of our mortality and the consequent sense of meaninglessness in our actions do not justify suicide, but rather underscore the value of life. According to Camus, the absurd arises from the conflict between our desire for meaning and the indifferent universe. Despite this, he asserts that we are born free and possess the autonomy to choose our paths, free from metaphysical constraints.\n\nCamus, an atheist, rejects the notion that any predetermined fate dictates our actions. He emphasizes that humans are inherently driven to seek knowledge and truth. Our quest to understand the world and ourselves is intrinsic, but it is an endeavor marked by an eternal gap, as complete comprehension remains elusive. Even in scientific endeavors, this gap persists, preventing any theory from being entirely definitive. The only certainty we have is our mortality. While the awareness of the absurd might lead some to contemplate suicide as a response to life's perceived futility, Camus firmly believes that the quest for knowledge and the ultimate truth of our mortality compel us to continue living. He encourages perseverance, affirming the intrinsic value of life despite its absurdity.", "speed": 0.5526527581736748, "eta": "00h11m36s"}

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education.

After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff. However, universities were often divided into new universities according to the political leanings of its professors, and have been held back by political squabbles.

Before the events of 1968, many argued that the universities were overcrowded, dirty, and heavily influenced by Paris. After 1968, Edgar Faure sought to grant universities more autonomy and reduce direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry remained responsible for building costs, universities were permitted to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and gain more freedom in choosing academic staff. Despite these changes, universities were often divided along political lines and became mired in political squabbles. Consequently, the prestige of a university graduate is not as high as that of his European counterparts. Universities have limited contact with the outside business world, and the divided nature of the UERs restricts cross-disciplinary collaboration. A university degree does not automatically guarantee a good job, and many students, including a \"jeune diplom\u00e9,\" might find themselves working in a supermarket checkout.\n\nStudents often wonder if the strain of the French university, which does not guarantee any future, is worth it. When it comes to top jobs, graduates of the \"Grandes Ecoles\" are given top priority. Described by \"The Guardian\" as \"The Crame de la Cream,\" these schools train an elite for future top careers in administration, industry, and government. Two-thirds of the top hundred French firms have directors who are ex-students of these schools, allowing privileged graduates to secure high-ranking careers and accelerated promotions.", "speed": 0.5526527581736748, "eta": "00h11m36s"}

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism.

The number of French employees unionized is relatively small (about 11%) and thus there is great competition between individual trade unions for membership, and a great distinction between the individual characteristics.\nDuring an economic expansion, as was experienced by France in the period 1945-75, unions can make demands for their workers for better pay and working conditions. But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.\nMembership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions has always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, those members who were left tended to be those who identified with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.\nBefore 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's demands, and this did not help the falling membership numbers.\nEmployers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation. This was because the great majority of firms in France were small family concerns which had sprung up in the 19th century - the PME (petites et moyennes entreprises).

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life.

Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was practiced and preached by his predecessors. So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.\nThe role of the president is defined in the Constitution but is rather ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an \"arbiter\". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the making of policies or does it mean he must intervene and play an active role?\nThe term 'arbiter' is sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this they did.

Past Presidents and Prime Ministers have both claimed responsibility, with some arguing for a twin-headed executive, although Prime Ministers have historically accepted Presidential supremacy.\n\nThe constitution states that the Prime Minister generally oversees the government, including functions such as appointing ministers. However, this responsibility has largely been taken over by the President, who has also assumed other functions.\n\nWhen asked about the Prime Minister's role, Giscard d'Estaing asserted that the Prime Minister handles contingency problems, while the President manages what is permanent and essential. This interpretation, while contradicting the spirit of the constitution, reflected the practices of his predecessors, leaving the Prime Minister's role as a still-contested issue.\n\nThe President's role, as defined in Article 5 of the Constitution, is equally vague and contentious. The term 'arbiter' is ambiguous; does it mean the President should maintain a neutral, impartial stance, or does it imply an active, interventionist role? The term's ambiguity allowed Presidents to interpret it as they wished, and De Gaulle claimed it granted him the authority to rule the nation. His successors similarly adopted an interventionist approach, reflecting this interpretation.\n\nIn summary, the constitution of the 5th Republic was a compromise that strengthened both the presidency and the executive branch. The roles of the Prime Minister and President remain contentious, with the Prime Minister's responsibilities often overshadowed by the President, whose role as an 'arbiter' has been subject to varied interpretations. The ambiguity inherent in the constitution's language has allowed successive Presidents to expand their influence, shaping the evolving nature of the office.", "speed": 0.5526527581736748, "eta": "00h11m36s"}

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "After the debacle of the Fourth Republic, which was marred by government and ministerial instability leading to a series of coalition governments whose power was very limited, there was a clear need in France for a strong government base.

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat', a similar r\u00f4le to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It gave the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debr\u00e9, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reserv\u00e9\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian r\u00f4le of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.\nArticle 11 was not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle used it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to use Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition.

Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century have been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, and the consequent ageing of the population.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have been in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, because it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't afford large families.\nThe consequence of these factors was that by the end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, as people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.\nAt the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number of old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and old people.

At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixi\u00e8me year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization. He tried to prolong school life for a large number of pupils by making education compulsory until the age of 16, abolishing the entrance examination to the 'sixi\u00e8me' and abandoning the 'classe de la fin des \u00e9tudes', where children stayed at primary school until 14.

The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair. The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Voltaire tackles the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide' by satirizing the idea that everything occurs for some good. In the novel, the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-ten-Tronckh.

For example, when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army, he endures severe beatings but remains indifferent, believing it is for his own good. Later in the book, he uses his training to become a soldier and kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop, without hesitation, and then proceeds to murder his sweetheart's brother.

The survivors, including Candide and Pangloss, witness starvation and death. Candide looks to Pangloss for comfort, but the philosopher can only suggest that some good will come of it.\n\nDespite this, Candide remains skeptical of philosophical optimism throughout the story. This skepticism becomes evident when Candide arrives in the New World, South America, and is forced to leave his beloved Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide struggles to see any potential good in the situation, especially since his journey to America was motivated by his desire to kill Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. As the narrative progresses, we see how Candide is gradually led away from the philosophy of optimism, revealing that the constant belief that good can come from bad is not inspiring but rather a source of continuous disaster.

When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss.

Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Instead of taking it apart and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\nVoltaire creates a series of great human sufferings brought on both by nature and mankind. In the midst of it all, Pangloss begins his philosophizing that these incidents are good and for the best, making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. For example, when Jacques drowns, Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die in Lisbon harbor.\n\nAnother example comes earlier in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars, meets an old 'tramp' on the road. He soon realizes it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westphalia have been destroyed, and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette. Despite this, Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, showing no despair. He merely states that if it were not for syphilis there would be no chocolate in the world. Through the complete absurdity of this comment, Voltaire tackles the problem of thoughtless optimism.", "speed": 0.5329040340557408, "eta": "00h11m02s"}

He was not necessarily against Leibniz, Shaftesbury and Wolff even though he ridiculed their standardized terminology, but utterly opposed the perversions of this doctrine which offered the contrary. Such perversions turned this philosophy of hope into one of despair.\n\n\tVoltaire used pessimism as the main stream of attacking the philosophical doctrine of optimism. In this he includes suffering and misery which abound in the book.\n\n\tMartin is the character which Voltaire uses to represent pessimism, the view that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil and that everything that happens is for the worst. He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cun\u00e9gonde again. It is this hope which helps him to complete his life long journey.\n\n\tConversly, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory - 'all is best in the best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best'. He was Candide's tutor, who stood by this doctrine, in spite of all his sufferings - his own hanging, flogging and dissection. Such thinking angered Voltaire that good always comes out of evil particularly since the recent events of his day distrusted him so greatly - a disaster such as the earthquake at Linis and Lisbon in which thousands of people perished. How can that contribute to the common good?\n\n\tEvery character involved in the book has endured much suffering including Candide himself. In a sense, he was blinded by following the illusion of the love of his life, lady Cun\u00e9gonde, who he planned to marry one day. Voltaire presented her as an object of desire, the only reason why Candide continued on his journey but when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed. She had changed in beauty and personality, she had become unbearable to live with. The point Voltaire wished to make was that supreme happiness was unobtainable.\n\n\tHe also attacked the philosophy by showing that goodness/kindness is never recriprocated eg. Jacques, the Anabaptist, considered as a good man, saved a sailor from drowning during a tremendous storm as they approached Lisbon harbour. He himself however was swept overboard with the sailor do nothing to help.

He criticized the standardized terminology of philosophers like Leibniz, Shaftesbury, and Wolff, who, despite their intentions, contributed to a philosophy that Voltaire saw as a source of despair rather than hope.\n\nVoltaire employed pessimism as his primary tool against the optimistic philosophy. He highlighted the suffering and misery that pervade the world, as depicted in his works. In particular, Voltaire used the character of Martin to represent pessimism, the belief that humans are inherently evil and that all events inevitably lead to the worst outcomes. Martin revels in destroying Candide's hope and dreams, particularly Candide's longing to reunite with his love, Lady Cun\u00e9gonde. This hope drives Candide's long and arduous journey, demonstrating Voltaire's argument that the pursuit of ultimate happiness is futile.\n\nConversely, the character of Pangloss embodies the optimistic theory that \"all is best in the best of all possible worlds.\" As Candide's tutor, Pangloss clings to this doctrine despite enduring immense suffering, including his own public humiliation of being hanged, flogged, and dissected. Voltaire's anger was fueled by recent events, such as the devastating earthquake in Lisbon, where thousands perished. He questioned how such disasters could contribute to the common good, thereby underscoring the absurdity of blind optimism.\n\nVoltaire's narrative also emphasized that suffering is a common experience for all characters, including Candide himself. Candide's unwavering belief in the love of his life, Lady Cun\u00e9gonde, led him on a journey filled with hope. However, when they finally meet, Candide is deeply disillusioned by her changed appearance and personality, which Voltaire used to illustrate the unattainability of supreme happiness.\n\nVoltaire further attacked the optimistic philosophy by demonstrating that goodness and kindness are often unreciprocated.

However, Jacques himself was swept overboard and drowned, with no one to help him. Even though Candide attempted to save him, it was too late.

Voltaire approaches his subject using evidence from facts. Throughout the book, Candide experiences a myriad of adventures in different countries, where he consistently encounters evil. Voltaire sought to demonstrate that human-inflicted evil was not only real but also universal, thereby vehemently challenging the principle that \"whatever is, is right.\"\n\nOptimism, as a philosophy, was developed by Leibniz. He argued that we lived in the best of all possible worlds and explained the existence of evil by suggesting that God had to introduce a minimal amount of evil into the world. A world that was entirely perfect would be divine and not suitable for humans. Pangloss, the character in the book, embodies this philosophy. He justifies all his misfortunes by claiming they are \"un ingr\u00e9dient n\u00e9cessaire\" (an indispensable ingredient) and always accepts them, believing that everything is for the best and for the best possible purpose, as God is Benevolent.\n\nVoltaire challenges these arguments, raising questions about their validity. If God is benevolent, why do the innocent suffer? Why do good men die? When an Anabaptist fell into the sea, Candide wanted to throw himself in to rescue him. However, Pangloss stopped him, reiterating that it was meant to be so. Voltaire rejects this fatalistic attitude and wants Candide to gradually question this stated opinion, think for himself, and free himself from optimism.\n\nAs Candide flees from Europe, he still strongly adheres to optimism, believing that \"in another universe, everything will be better.\" He hopes he will find the best of all possible worlds. However, he soon realizes that everywhere is the same. Everywhere, he encounters greed, war, violence, and religious persecution\u2014universal facts that undermine the optimistic philosophy.", "speed": 0.5329040340557408, "eta": "00h11m02s"}

However this wit does not swamp the undertones of the serious point Voltaire makes about philisophical optimism. The book is very much the mirror image of Voltaires life as he doesn't believe in optimism. One should simply help others and live in reality within ones limited knowledge. He therefore sets out to prove these points in Candide.\n\tVoltaire's character Pangloss is the mouthpiece for philosophical optimism and what happens to him serves to denounce optimism. Pangloss believes in divine providence, what happens happens for a reason and for the good of society. It is at this point that Voltaire ridicules this idea. Pangloss contracts syphillis which when you follow it back to its origin comes from the crew of Christopher Columbus's ship when he brought chocolate back fron one of his voyages. Pangloss however claims that he doesn't mind having syphillis because otherwise people wouldn't have known what chocolate was. The reader obviously laughs at this theory of optimism and Voltaire has succeeded in proving what a stupid unethical theory it is. The fact that Pangloss remains adamant in his belief of philosophical optimism could also demonstrate Voltaire's low opinion on those who believe in it.\n\tPhilosophical optimism has the principle that all is for the best and Voltaire tackles this assumption not only through Panglosses suffering but also the suffering of innocent people who are victims. If you are stupid enough to believe in it then you deserve what fate awaits you. However the fact that innocent people are killed serves to condemn this philosophy.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Candide is a humorous tale of a young man who begins his journey in search of his ideal.

The innocent victims, who deserve no such fate, serve to condemn this philosophy.

A central idea to the philosophy of optimism.\n\tVoltaire uses the character of Pangloss to represent the optimism view point and he uses Pangloss as a vehicle for ridiculing the philosophy.

Pangloss is shown as seeing everything as being \"for the best\". When he catches syphillis he says that it is a good thing, for without the import of the disease from Southern America we would not have chocolate or cochineal. The idiocy of his argument and the dry dogma he tries to enforce on others, especially Candide, serve to ridicule optimism and denounce it as having any philosophical worth. While Candide lies dying Pangloss philosophises rather than seeking help. Following the terrible earthquake (a real contempory event) Pangloss sees it as being sent from God because those people must die. It was therefore \"for the best\". He views the drowning of Jacques, following his attempt to help a sailor in distress as also being \"for the best\". Voltaire therefore questions and rejects optimism and uses Pangloss to acheive this aim.\n\tThe character of Martin is used to introduce the opposite views to optimism, those of pessimism. Martin takes great pleasure in defeating all Candide's hopes of finding his beloved Cun\u00e9gonde again. Voltaire said that \"Martin est manicheen come moi,\" we could therefore suppose that he is a character close to Voltaire's own views and he is used to show an alternative to optimism which is more realistic.

One of the most dominant being that of Optimism.\n\tThe idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches his philosophy at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cun\u00e9gonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721.

This would cover four main areas of British society: i) economic, ii) political, iii) defense, and iv) legal.\n\nAs far as economics is concerned, British independent economic policy would be undermined, primarily because being in a monetary union with other states would lead to the loss of exchange rates as a method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain. The British government would no longer be in a position to devalue or revalue the pound to regain competitiveness with European neighbors. This could result in Britain becoming an unproductive backwater in Europe. Moreover, the Bank of England would lose the right to print and distribute an independent currency, the pound, and the British government would lose control over all monetary policy. This is because a central European bank would have jurisdiction over exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation rates. Consequently, Britain would be left with only fiscal policy to control its economy. There are even rumors that this may be centralized in a new Europe, encompassing everything from tax policy to social security payments.\n\nAs a natural consequence of this, there would be a political loss of sovereignty, as British instructions would have no effective power. Already, there is a European Parliament, whose powers are being expanded.", "speed": 0.5329040340557408, "eta": "00h11m02s"}

Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body.

It involves the expansion of the british market into all the other markets of Europe and vice versa. One will see the disappearance of all tariff barriers and customs and this in turn will allow for the free movement within Europe.\n\t\tBritain is very apprehensive. As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The British will find it very difficult to take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called \"the Continent\" - as though it were a separate entity).\n\t\tThe obvious advantage is the far wider market open to British industry and a bigger jobs market. \nBut one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could use their own currency without having to pay such things as import tax. But I feel the British would resent the use of ECU - taking away the pound would be taking away part of Britain's own identity. Is it why many British people are slow to educate themselves about the future plans, despite the fact it is being hailed as a great step forward ?\n\t\tWith the mergence of all the individual markets, paper-pushing will be reduced as there will be no more exchange controls with a single currency and the bureau de change will also become redundant. Staff that controlled customs would have to be merged into the intercontinental customs control and staffing would have to be cut down.\n\t\tAnother negative move is the plans discussed for legislation. Suggestions have been put forward for the adoption of the present system to one central legislative power for Europe as a whole. This idea does not seem acceptable to the British public. I feel if each country held onto its own system of legislation then they would also hold on to their own good feeling of identity, which would be lost under a central power.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Everyone eagerly anticipates the arrival of 1992 and the introduction of the single market for the European Economic Community.

The nation may find it challenging to accept orders from a governing power on the Continent, which still seems like a separate entity.\n\nThe most obvious advantage of the single market is the much larger market accessible to British industry and the potential for a bigger jobs market. However, one group will face difficulties. Firms that have traditionally relied on importing goods for Britain will be affected by the introduction of the European Currency Unit (ECU). The ECU, a planned single currency within Europe, will simplify purchasing imported components. If successful, firms can buy goods with the ECU without incurring import taxes or using their own currency. Many British people, however, resent the introduction of the ECU, fearing that adopting it would be akin to losing a part of Britain's identity. This reluctance to embrace the future plans, despite their potential benefits, contributes to the slow pace of British public education on these matters.\n\nWith the merger of individual markets, the need for extensive paperwork will diminish, as there will be no more exchange controls and redundant bureau de change services. Customs control will also be streamlined, leading to a reduction in staffing.\n\nAnother concerning aspect is the proposed legislation. Suggestions have been made to adopt a central legislative power for Europe. This idea is not widely accepted by the British public, as it would mean relinquishing their unique systems of legislation. Many Britons fear that this centralization would result in the loss of their national identity.\n\nIn summary, while the single market promises numerous benefits, concerns about identity and sovereignty remain significant obstacles for Britain as it navigates this transformative period.", "speed": 0.5329040340557408, "eta": "00h11m02s"}

We segregate ourselves, considering ourselves an island with no real frontiers between us and other nations.\n\nHowever, this perception has already changed, as the Channel Tunnel is well underway. Having made physical contact by drilling the same tunnel and meeting halfway, we have created an era where it could be said that we in Britain are no longer living on an island, at least in the traditional sense. Of course, we are still geographically an island, but soon we will be able to drive to Europe without even seeing the sea.\n\nThis first contact was a monumental moment in history, indicating a physical link. Prior to this, we had numerous contacts with Europe. The 1972 European Communities Act, which we signed in 1973, marked a significant step towards Britain losing its sovereignty, as we began to integrate more closely with European institutions.\n\nSovereignty depends on a nation making its own laws and deciding its future independently of others. Even now, Britain has lost much of its independence. All EEC laws apply to all members, meaning that even if something is not British law, it can be enforced in our country by a European court. This is where one of the greatest problems lies, as the British are so proud of their own legal history. Much of our law is judge-made, resulting in many legal disputes with deep-rooted decisions and remedies.

There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system.\n\t\tDespite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman, namely Lord Cofield, there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market, shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers, whereas Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.\n\t\tIn accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. Consequently the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national is inevitably a problem. One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties. However these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals, so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual, he cannot place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom, by an Act of Parliament.

Weary of invasion or interference from outside, this type of mentality can be seen amongst the British even today. Therefore, when discussing the idea of a single Europe, the British feel under threat.\n\tAs the year 1992 comes closer, \"a new pawn for Europe\", there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding what will actually happen. In Britain, there has been little emphasis on the involvement for everybody in a single Europe. Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers even, but not really, the average person on the street.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. But the extent to which this happen depends on the role and the power of the european Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps, a single currency, so this of course would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an \"advisory committee\" for the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc, will be seen as merely an extension of the E.E.C. and nothing more. But if the majority of legislation were to come from Brussels, then I think the British would feel a great loss of sovereignty and even resentment.\n\tObviously, a united Europe is not going to erase centuries of culture to form one identifiable \"European culture\"; but this might always be a worry for the British, (and probably, for other countries too). Thus a loss of power for the British Parliament would probably be seen as the first step of this \"merging together\". Nevertheless, one should not forget the role of the citizens. If they do not want to \"become European\" then they will not do so. They would have to respect the European Parliament, but in every other way life could carry on as normal. It goes without saying that they would want to take advantage of, say, better trade agreements between countries, cheaper holidays etc, but I can not envisage a mass exodus across the Channel.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Britain, an island nation, has always experienced a unique type of isolation absent in other European countries.

On this island at the very edge of Europe however we do have a particularly low reputation for fighting change and for general xenophobia. What are we afraid of ?\n\tPerhaps the most unpopular EC policy in this country is the Common Agricultural Policy Regulations about the amount of food we are allowed to produce as a country have been portrayed on television as farmers forced to slaughter their livestock because of low quotas and large amounts of milk going off as farmers are not allowed to sell it. If you mention the common agricultural policy to an Englishman most of them will immediately think of the butter mountains wine lakes and surpluses of meat. The positive elements of the policy do not get as much publicity as the negative ones.\n\tSo the EC is widely viewed in Britain as an institution which interferes with and disrupts the British economy and way of life rather than enhancing it.\n\tThe idea of \"sovereignty\" is an old established term in the world of international relations and is generally accepted to mean that while other states may have a right to have some say in a way that a state  runs its foreign affairs, the domestic affairs of that state are the concern of that state alone and no other state should interfere. The military interpretation of sovereignty is not as relevant in the context of this argument.

On this island at the very edge of Europe, however, we do have a particularly low reputation for fighting change and for general xenophobia. What are we afraid of?\n\nPerhaps the most unpopular EC policy in this country is the Common Agricultural Policy Regulations, which dictate the amount of food we are allowed to produce. These policies have been portrayed on television as farmers forced to slaughter their livestock because of low quotas and large amounts of milk going off as farmers are not allowed to sell it. If you mention the common agricultural policy to an Englishman, most will immediately think of the butter mountains, wine lakes, and surpluses of meat. While the positive elements of the policy do not get as much publicity as the negative ones, this portrayal contributes to the perception of the EC as an institution that interferes with and disrupts the British economy and way of life rather than enhancing it.\n\nThe idea of \"sovereignty\" is an old-established term in the world of international relations and is generally accepted to mean that while other states may have a right to have some say in a way that a state runs its foreign affairs, the domestic affairs of that state are the concern of that state alone, and no other state should interfere. While the military interpretation of sovereignty is not as relevant in the context of this argument, it is the perception that the EC is interfering in the economic affairs of each country that causes so much discontent.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice. The           for the European Community will be the year 1992 when the internal market will be completed and trade barriers lifted and there will be common policies on social level.\n\tThis closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "After the devastations of the second World War, closer cooperation has existed among European states on all levels. First and foremost, trade treaties were established between various countries, leading to the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome, which has attracted an increasing number of members over the years.

This government makes and exercises policies without interference from other countries across economic, domestic, and foreign policy areas. It is clear that the sovereignty of European Community member states remains intact, as countries continue to make independent decisions.\n\nHowever, European law, decided by the Council and the European Parliament, sometimes takes precedence over national law and is applied throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This is necessary for the effective functioning of the internal market in 1992. Legislation in the European institutions, involving ministers and MEPs from various countries, means that some sovereignty must be ceded.\n\nConcerns are understandable given these circumstances. Nevertheless, crucial issues such as defense, the economy, and the actual running of the country remain in the hands of national governments. Balancing the benefits of closer cooperation with the preservation of national sovereignty continues to be a sensitive and important consideration for member states.", "speed": 0.5603128296764899, "eta": "00h09m32s"}

It's intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services, capital and the workforce.\n\tThe competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods. Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance. European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market. The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced, hopefully to the highest common denominator.\n\tThe European does not serve only as a useful trade association, however, for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together. Co-operation between the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug-smuggling and terrorism. The common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources.\n\t However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur. The single European Act was designed to speed-up the decision making of certain institutions. The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co-operation and joint action in the areas of foreign, social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members. The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law, which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty. More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe.\n\tThe question is how much sovereignty is Britain prepared to lose and do the benefits of belonginging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages. A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt and in the next few years this will increase. As far as the immediate future is concerned a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The European Community, comprising 12 sovereign European States, aims to foster closer economic and political cooperation. Its goal is to enhance the free movement of goods, services, capital, and the workforce. The competition for trade in modern times is fierce, and Britain finds itself compelled to join Europe to expand the market for its goods. Recognized for its expertise in banking and insurance, Britain views the European market as an opportunity to leverage these skills across a broader audience. The creation of a unified European commercial market will benefit consumers, as the homogenization of standards progresses toward the highest common denominator.\n\nHowever, the European Community's role extends beyond mere trade facilitation. Environmental challenges can be addressed more effectively through collective action. Cooperation between community police forces will help mitigate issues like drug smuggling and terrorism. Additionally, a unified defense policy spanning such a large area of Europe could be more cost-effective if member states pooled their resources.\n\nNonetheless, this integration entails an inevitable loss of national sovereignty. The single European Act was designed to expedite decision-making within certain institutions, necessitating member governments to commit to maximum cooperation and joint action in foreign, social, and environmental policies. This leaves less room for divergent opinions among member states. The European Court of Justice's decisions already take precedence over national law, which some view as a significant encroachment on national sovereignty. Greater participation in electing members of the European Parliament could help ensure that those most committed to promoting British interests are elected.\n\nThe question remains: how much sovereignty Britain is willing to sacrifice, and do the benefits of belonging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages?

One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community, made up from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community.\n\tIn 1987, the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992. This act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or not it will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain.\n\tThe lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade. This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\tBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain.

The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created. It believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns, however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community was to bring in a single currency, Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality, but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange.

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.

For every American\nthat sees capital punishment as a senseless and unnecessary act of\nviolence, there are several who believe that this sentence is the\nultimate act of justice.\nFor as long as the act of capital punishment has been around, the\narguments for and against it have also been clearly present. When forced\nto compare these arguments, it is clear that the argument opposing the\ndeath penalty is both stronger and more sensible. While it can be\ndemonstrated that both sides of the capital punishment argument have\nstrengths and weaknesses, it is the \"anti\u001edeath\" argument that\nultimately presents a more powerful case. The value of human life plays\na huge role in the arguments both for and against the death penalty. The\nfocus of this essay is to analyze the conflicting arguments concerning\nthe death penalty and to show how the value of human life is affected by\nthese arguments.\nThe arguments in favor of capital punishment revolve around the ancient\nbiblical concept of \"an eye for an eye\". For example, a criminal who\nmurders should himself be murdered to fulfill what is considered by many\nto be justice. It is most often the family members of victims who\nsupport this ideology. These feelings must be understood because of the\namount of rage that these people experience towards the perpetrator of\nthe crime. Anyone who is placed in their shoes would wish for the death\npenalty to be administered to the guilty party. Advocates of the death\npenalty, such as Robert Hoyler, support this claim by stating, <*>. This\npresents a strong point in the argument in favor of capital punishment.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The highest sentence that can be enforced by the American Judicial system is that of death. Capital punishment has been carried out on criminals for quite some time, but it has never been without strong opposition. Many people view capital punishment as a heinous act that is morally incorrect. Despite this, the majority of Americans still support capital punishment. For every American that sees it as a senseless and unnecessary act of violence, there are several who believe it is the ultimate act of justice.\n\nThe debate regarding capital punishment has been ongoing for as long as the practice has existed, presenting clearly defined arguments for and against it. When comparing these arguments, the opposition to the death penalty is generally considered stronger and more sensible. Although both sides have their strengths and weaknesses, the anti-death penalty argument ultimately presents a more compelling case. The value of human life plays a significant role in these arguments, and the focus of this essay is to analyze the conflicting viewpoints concerning the death penalty and show how these arguments affect the value of human life.\n\nThe arguments in favor of capital punishment often hinge on the ancient biblical concept of \"an eye for an eye.\" For instance, the idea is that a criminal who murders should himself be murdered to fulfill what many consider to be justice. This perspective is most often supported by the family members of victims who experience a great deal of rage towards the perpetrator of the crime. Most anyone in their shoes would wish for the death penalty to be administered to the guilty party. Advocates of the death penalty, such as Robert Hoyler, argue that this concept provides a strong point in favor of capital punishment. They believe that justice is served when the punishment matches the crime. This perspective underscores the belief that capital punishment serves as a form of ultimate justice, reinforcing the idea that the lives taken must be balanced by an equal measure of punishment. \n\nIn conclusion, the debate over capital punishment is deeply rooted in contrasting views of justice and the value of human life. While proponents argue that it serves as a just retribution for heinous crimes, opponents contend that it is morally indefensible. Despite the ongoing controversy, the majority of Americans continue to support capital punishment, reflecting a complex and enduring national divide on this critical issue.", "speed": 0.5603128296764899, "eta": "00h09m32s"}

Health services, on the other hand, argue that surrogate motherhood fulfills a human longing in the lives of infertile couples. By claiming that surrogacy satisfies a void, the author suggests that infertile couples view their childless state as a gap to be filled. They often overlook the surrogate mother's feelings, seeing her merely as a reproductive vessel. In many cases, the surrogate mother's feelings and well-being are disregarded, as the focus is solely on fulfilling the couple's desire for a child. \n\nOpposing this perspective, some argue that the longing of the parents to satisfy both biological and emotional needs is not significant enough to warrant the surrogate mother's suffering. While the infertile mother may feel a biological connection to the child, she may not be capable of parenting. However, many people around the world have lives that are not impacted by infertility. Surrogate motherhood allows the father to reproduce, but it can also leave the adoptive mother feeling excluded.

Today, scientists have names for illnesses and discovered cures for many of them. It is now common to simply ask a physician, \"for something,\" when sickness occurs. But what about more complex conditions in humans? Tests are constantly being performed to find the next medication that will control the ailment. Some skeptics, though, will not believe the true results these new drugs are showing. They simply turn away from the drug and call for its banishment. Such a controversial drug is the anti-depressant Prozac. Despite the controversy, Prozac should continue to be prescribed in dealing with the symptoms of depression because of the positive effects it has already made in medicine and society. Further discussion will reveal how people have improved their symptoms and devalue the rumors brought about by this new drug.\n\nProzac was originally invented to cure the symptoms of depression in people. But how does Prozac accomplish this? It treats depression by affecting one system of the brain, where a chemical called serotonin is. The drug causes the serotonin to slow in the spaces between the nerve cells, which makes communication between the nerve cells more efficient. It also works to stop bulimia, panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other conditions. One doctor commented that Prozac helped patients feel \"better than well.\" One case study involved an architect named Sam, who felt the drug made him feel \"better than well.\" He became more poised, thoughtful, and could concentrate much easier than before. Most importantly, his symptoms of depression disappeared.\n\nThe drug has also been tested and found safe by all major pharmaceutical agencies. Patients do not experience the dry mouth, constipation, and rapid heartbeat found in other anti-depressants. To scientists, Prozac is viewed as \"clean\" because of the specific job it does. It is different from other mood-altering drugs such as opium and marijuana, because its effect is \"even and sustained.\" Patients don't feel the up and down effect that other \"street\" drugs bring. One physician noted that Prozac's non-addictive effects and large public usage provide positive support for the drug.

We both blushed, chuckled and shrugged it off to\nembarrassment. Although I had many questions for my Father, the talk of\nsexual relationships was never spoken of again. However, my curiosities\nabout sexual relationships still existed. Finally at the age of eighteen\nI gave in to peer pressures to have sexual intercourse. I decided to\nhave sex with a class mate to feel socially accepted by my peers. My\nvalues and beliefs regarding sexual relationships caused me to commit to\nthe relationship. Having sex just to have sex is considered casual sex.\nCasual sex is unacceptable, its degrading, animalistic, and runs the\nrisk of disease. After a few months of dating she became pregnant. From\nthis moment on, my life would never be the way I expected it. At\neighteen I needed to make life altering decisions with my mate on what\nour options were. We felt the right decision was to get married, have\nthe child, and live happily ever after. We were wrong, after a few\ndifficult years of marriage we divorced. The lack of parental guidance\nregarding sexual relationships for youths' emphasizes the need for\nschools to teach children morals and values of sexual relationships.\nWe send our children to school to educate them. Through educating them\nwe hope they learn enough of these tools to guide them through life so\nthat they may be successful and happy. Some of these tools are the\nmorals and values that sexual relationships are based on.

Although I had many questions for my Father, the talk of sexual relationships was never spoken of again. However, my curiosities about sexual relationships still existed. Finally, at the age of eighteen, I gave in to peer pressures to have sexual intercourse. I decided to have sex with a classmate to feel socially accepted by my peers. My values and beliefs regarding sexual relationships caused me to commit to the relationship. Having sex just to have sex is considered casual sex. Casual sex is unacceptable, it's degrading, animalistic, and runs the risk of disease. After a few months of dating, she became pregnant. From that moment on, my life would never be the way I expected it. At eighteen, I needed to make life-altering decisions with my mate about their options. We felt the right decision was to get married, have the child, and live happily ever after. We were wrong, and after a few difficult years of marriage, we divorced. The lack of parental guidance regarding sexual relationships for youths highlights the need for schools to teach children morals and values of sexual relationships. We send our children to school to educate them. Through educating them, we hope they learn enough of these tools to guide them through life so that they may be successful and happy. Some of these tools are the morals and values that sexual relationships are based on. The morals and values I speak of in a sexual relationship are the abstinence from sexual intercourse without a commitment toward marriage.

This is entirely\nethical and in most cases necessary to continue to have many of the\nprograms and facilities that the universities offer. To accomplish this,\nmany universities add courses and provide new things such as research\nlabs and new cutting edge equipment. Many universities even try to\naccommodate the changing needs of the students by providing services\nsuch as free tutors and bigger staffs.\nBut not once before have I heard of a university trying to attract\nstudents with grass, trees, and a fountain. To be exact, about five city\nblocks of it, none the least. That's right, our very own Marquette\nUniversity is trying what in my opinion is one of the most unethical\nideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to attend to\ndifferent racial histories and so\u001ecalled physcological differences. This\ngreen space is supposed to create a more comfortable learning\nenvironment, but might just reverse this comfort when students see the\ncost of just under five blocks of grass. It's a whopping ten million\ndollars that the students, not the gesus, are going to pay. Even if they\ndivvy it up over twenty or so years, many students can't afford this\nincrease. I myself am barely scraping by. Plus this grass will cost\nlocals a matching ten million dollars just to reroute all of the\nutilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue.\nSome of the utilities effected by the common's project will be local\nbuses. If many of you noticed, about three to five routes come through\nMarquette's planned commons and that just might cause problems. The\ntransit company is estimating to lose between \"$1 million and $600,000,\"\nwhich the university is trying to offset by getting students on the U\u001e\npass system. The University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this\nsystem. I feel that this won't help, considering that a large number of\nstudents that already use the county transit and contribute to the\nprofits of the county's transit. I feel that the city might lose more mo\nney, rather than less, as Marquette thought through the U\u001epass system.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In all of the colleges and universities across the United States, administrators are striving to increase enrollment. This initiative is largely ethical and often necessary to maintain and expand the programs and facilities that universities offer. To achieve this, many universities introduce new courses and enhance their offerings with research labs and cutting-edge equipment. Additionally, universities cater to the changing needs of students by providing services such as free tutors and larger staff.\n\nHowever, I have never heard of a university attempting to attract students by investing in green spaces like grass, trees, and a fountain, spanning about five city blocks. Marquette University, for instance, is embarking on what I consider one of the most questionable endeavors to lure students, akin to UCLA's controversial addition of classes focused on various racial and physiological histories. The intention behind the green space is to create a more comfortable learning environment, but I worry it could ironically undermine student comfort by imposing the cost of nearly five blocks of grass, totaling around ten million dollars, on them. This expense is daunting, especially given that many students are already struggling financially. Moreover, the local community will also bear the ten million dollar cost for rerouting utilities through Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nPart of the project will affect local buses, with three to five routes passing through Marquette's planned green space. The transit company estimates a loss of between $1 million and $600,000. Marquette University is attempting to mitigate this loss by encouraging students to use the UPass system. However, I am skeptical about its effectiveness. Many students already utilize the county transit and contribute to its profits, implying that the city's expenses may actually increase rather than decrease, contrary to Marquette's expectations.", "speed": 0.538875788593948, "eta": "00h08m56s"}

The second idea is that it is too\ndifficult to determine if a person will suffer too much in his or her\nlifetime to go on living. This idea is held together by the fact that\nthere is too much gray areas within ethics and that patients or doctors\ncan not decisively determine whether a live is worth living.

The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish.

For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive.

For instance, someone dying of lung cancer may think about their family and friends when they attempt suicide. The person may want to spare their loved ones from the pain of their passing. In such cases, the suffering experienced by the individual is immense, and the family might feel helpless in comforting them. Rauscher might not have considered the emotional toll on the family, nor the potential relief the individual seeks by ending their suffering.

Some people, however, are impatient and look for easier ways to earn money, resorting to stealing, selling drugs, or dealing in illegal contraband. I know several people who fit this category of not wanting to pursue wealth legally; they are more interested in the \u201cget rich quick\u201d mentality. Some of them have acquired riches illegally, but the problem is, as the title of this essay states, \u201cCrime does not pay.\u201d\n\nCrime does not pay, as is evident from the story of a man who chose to get rich quickly through dishonest means. His family was proud of him, unaware of his illegal activities, believing he was involved in legitimate real estate ventures. For about a year, they enjoyed the benefits of his newfound wealth, which allowed them to buy things they previously couldn't afford. However, their joy was short-lived when they saw their father's picture on the news. Suddenly, they received a call informing them that he had been arrested and was in jail. Their dreams shattered, they were shocked to learn of his criminal activities. The news revealed a greedy businessman who took money from elderly couples by scamming them with false promises about good real estate investments. This painful revelation highlighted the consequences of his actions, ultimately showing that crime does not pay.", "speed": 0.5663529541988326, "eta": "00h07m33s"}

Because of the differences in personalities and ambition, I feel it is vital that in today's society men and women should be financially reward for their individual efforts.\nIn a society each person has the same basic needs for survival. Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up of majority of each person's day. In order to feed your family you had to plant. In order to live you had to build. To have clothing, you had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times the harder you worked, the more food, shelter or clothing you gained.

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims. I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true, but now many employers are the victims. They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I agree that historically, women have faced challenges regarding their roles in both the workplace and at home. Society often looked down on women who sought to advance professionally, and there has been a noticeable pay disparity for the same job when comparing men and women. Gone are the days when women were expected to stay home; now, many women work, while those who choose to stay home do so by choice. Much of this evolution in women's roles can be attributed to the efforts of feminists, groups dedicated to defending women over time.\n\nThese feminists have demonstrated to the modern world the capabilities of women in the workplace. However, they have not addressed the diverse needs and desires of all women. Some women were content with traditional roles, while others sought more opportunities. As a result, many women feel pressured to conform to feminist ideals, fearing negative judgments from their peers. For example, during the Iraq war, feminists strongly advocated for women to serve in combat positions. This stance sparked controversy, with some arguing that women are not as physically capable for such roles and could be at risk of rape if captured. Others, however, supported the idea, believing that it was unfair to exclude men from these roles.\n\nFeminists have also highlighted issues of workplace promotions and sexual harassment. Many women believe they are victims of these problems, and while this may have been true in the past, there is now a growing concern that some employers are becoming the victims. Employers may be hesitant to trust women, fearing they might outshine them. This sentiment can lead to unfair treatment, as women may be perceived differently in the workplace.\n\nIn summary, while feminists have made significant strides in improving women's roles, their one-size-fits-all approach has not addressed the varying needs and desires of all women. As society continues to evolve, it is important to consider the diverse perspectives within the women's movement.", "speed": 0.5663529541988326, "eta": "00h07m33s"}

Why? Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter. With this attitude someone could definitely headed for destruction. Its's like when you are a small child trying to see just how much your parents will let you get away with before they discipline you. For an individual that starts out doing small crimes (or less serious crimes that do not harm or endanger the life of another indivudual or a group of people) each time that they are not caught, that just makes them want to try just one more thing that they feel that they may just slide with, and the cycle goes on and on. Once you reach this stage you can consider yourself a habitual offender or someone that needs some kind of jail sentence, punishment or some type of deterent to stop you if not slow you down.\nBesides the fact that you will eventually get caught doing a crime your punishment varies according to the type of crime or crimes that the individual has committed. For example you can expect to get a stiffer punishment for a crime whrn you have endangered someone's life or their personal safety in some way.

It contains a common truth that is to often overlooked: in the world crime actually costs money. As we read the daily paper, listen to the evening news or speak to other people we hear stories of how crime has robbed individuals of possessions, jobs and lives.\nThe individual who commits a crime, if and when they are caught will in most cases be faced with the loss of his or her freedom. If the individual is incarcerated whether for one hour or for a lifetime money will be lost on the cost of incarceration. This money may not come from the perpetrator of the crime but it will come from the individual's family, freinds and acquantances in the form of tax dollars. As the number of criminals increases so to will the tax money needed to house these individuals. \nThe moral aspect of crime for the criminal is also something to take into account. For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse and sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom. When convicted of a crime a mere \"I'm sorry\" will not undo the loss or pain already inflicted. The criminal will have to live with his or her actions as long as they live.\nThe law abiding citizen also knows that crime does not pay. When an area of a city becomes known for a high crime rate the result is a drop in the real estate value for that area. so even though an individual can try to add value to his or her real estate possessions in these areas the effect of crime will cause a direct loss of money for the law abiding citizen.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The phrase \"crime actually costs money\" is a common truth that is often overlooked.

This lack of skill and the social repercussions contribute to the low likelihood of financial success for those involved in unorganized crime. Now that I have shared my thoughts on unorganized crime, I will turn my attention to the complexities and dangers of organized crime.", "speed": 0.5663529541988326, "eta": "00h07m33s"}

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I beg to disagree; crime does pay. Many criminals lead far better lives than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Embracing a criminal lifestyle offers numerous advantages: you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you have control over your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's compare the criminal life to the life of a hardworking person. In our changing economy, any individual who holds down a job must be concerned about job security. Many people are being laid off or let go because companies are no longer making enough profit to pay their employees. A criminal will always have work, as there is never a lack of work and a means for continuing employment.\n\nNow, consider the typical workday of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day, making approximately $7.50 per hour, totaling $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. With tax deductions running about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance costing another $5.00 per week, the average worker's take-home pay is reduced to $266.00 per week. This means that, unlike the average worker, a criminal can earn the same amount, $300.00, in just one hour of work without worrying about deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Additionally, the criminal is their own boss and can work at any time, at any pace.\n\nFinally, consider the aspect of retirement. Both criminals and average workers aim to retire, but criminals can potentially retire much earlier if they've managed to save portions of the money they've stolen over the years. For instance, if a criminal starts working at age 15 and works just 5 hours per week until they are 30, they could earn $1,170,000.00 over 15 years. Investing half of this amount could provide a steady source of income through interest earnings alone, enabling a comfortable retirement.\n\nComparing both options, I'd still argue that crime does pay.", "speed": 0.5663529541988326, "eta": "00h07m33s"}

Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs.

These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories;  accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc.  The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.  The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster.  Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.\nThe mental effect of computers is two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, etc. People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.  What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.  Granted, it is the person who \"told\" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated \"was able to do with a computer\", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict.  Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many \"variables\".\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation in factories and in fields like accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs. However, the effects of the computer are two-fold: while it has made life easier in many ways, it has also posed significant challenges.\n\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, computers are ubiquitous, streamlining tasks from word processors to spreadsheet/database programs. Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Almost everyone has at least one simple computer, such as a calculator. While a lengthy list of uses isn\u2019t necessary, it\u2019s clear that computers are incredibly abundant, even in 2nd and 3rd world countries.\n\nThe mental effects of computers are equally significant. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do that many people don\u2019t fully understand how or why their computers work. This has led to a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, and functions. People can easily perform calculus or other complex calculations with a computer. However, what many don\u2019t realize is that computers make errors all the time. While it is often the person who \"told\" the computer what to do, if they truly understood the task or were better equipped to use the computer, they would not have made errors. Mathematical models, theories, etc., are riddled with errors because there are many variables people don't know or can't predict, leading to frequent mistakes.\n\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people. Computer circuits don\u2019t get tired and can be programmed to work perfectly, assuming the programming is flawless, which is another challenging task. This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work. The effects of this are unpredictable, leading to feelings of anger, frustration, fear, and other negative emotions that have arisen simultaneously with the rise of computer usage. \n\nIn conclusion, while the computer has revolutionized many aspects of life and work, it has also introduced new challenges and complexities that society must navigate.", "speed": 0.5680633837416788, "eta": "00h06m36s"}

Perhaps the greatest invention and discovery is the polio vaccine, invented by Salk, which changed the future, and future's children. The effects of such a vaccine are countless and inequivalent to any other invention of the 20th century. Why was it so great?  It changed the population  and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.\n\t For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease. Thanks to Dr. Salk we are a little bit more protected than we would have been before, living in a world of uncertainty.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "For centuries before, millions of people were left dead, or permanently maimed because of disease.

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too. Unfortunately, wars have used airplanes. Japan bombing Pearl Habor, for example, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the airplane has drastically changed the lives of many people.

Though advances in communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk.  In the second of the world wars, the race was on to create the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known.

Lastly, I would like to discuss how all this has affected the family. It is obvious that T.V. has changed communicating within the family.

This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work.  \n\tThe first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations a second.  With the advancement in technology and the move toward miniaturization, the desktop PC has evolved.  These small, relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their  predecessors did and much more.  Every day new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools.\n\tThe impact of computers on the world has been great.  They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information is dealt with. In short, the productivity of people has increased ten-fold.

At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.

A very capricious decade, it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the \"Great Depression\" of the 30's. How could we ever forget the \"Fabulous Fifties\" or the hippie decade of the 60's and 70's? For change is inevitable, and as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the decade, there is one aspect of the 20th Century that will remain with me forever. So as we embark on the year 2000, I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century, \"The Century of Democracy.\"\n\tPerhaps, it is because today is November 4th, the day after the U.S. elections. Perhaps, it is because the former superpower of the Soviet Union is now making its transition into a democracy. Perhaps, it is because I am thousands of miles from my home, but I'm feeling very patriotic these days.\n No, I'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen from the United States. Rather, I'm feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations.\n\tIn the past 2 years alone, we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe. Not too long ago, I remember the democratic demonstrations that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic superpower. At the World Expo in Sevilla, not a month ago, I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall- the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War.

The extend to which this invention has altered people's lives is astronomical.  The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people's perceptions of the entire world.

One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease, hunger, and threatening weather;  also as noted above, it was extremely time consuming.  Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world.

I'm able to store almost all the information I need for school & for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper & records of all sorts, I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer. This means I'm able to store more information in an organized fashion. Though I have only used a fraction of my computer's ability, I'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have. Aside from being able to store great amounts of info, I'm also able to process & to edit things quickly. For example, without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month & had to this w/ a calculator, a pen & a piece of paper. Of course, this was very time consuming & open to error. W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make. Also, w/ the use of the Word Processor I'm able to edit & rearrange documents w/out altering the entire document, & furthermore, though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer, this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful. My father has the same program in his computer & is able to buy on line tickets w/out leaving the house  & moreover w/out picking up the phone. Also, I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited & that the power of computers, for me, is incomprehensible.\n\tI'm now here in Madrid. How did I get there? Well, I applied to the this program, was accepted, & flew here form the US. But, w/out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University, no doubt. Instead, once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer. W/out this luxury, the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork & things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced. When booking my flight, though I did not do this myself, the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Computers have certainly transformed the way we live, and I can personally attest to this change. I have a computer, and it has revolutionized the way I manage information. Instead of a cluttered desk full of paper and records, I now store all my essential school and personal documents on my computer, eliminating the need to keep physical copies. This allows me to keep more information organized and easily accessible.\n\nWhile I have only scratched the surface of what my computer can do, I am aware of the vast opportunities it provides. In addition to storing information, a computer can process and edit documents quickly and efficiently. For instance, balancing my checkbook used to be a time-consuming task involving a calculator, pen, and paper, which was also prone to errors. With my computer, I programmed it to handle these calculations, saving me both time and effort. My Word Processor allows me to edit and rearrange documents without altering the entire document, which is a significant convenience.\n\nI have yet to fully explore the Communications program on my computer, but it appears to be incredibly useful. My father uses it to purchase online tickets without leaving the house or picking up the phone. This experience highlights the power and potential of computers, even though my exposure to it is still limited.\n\nNow, I'm in Madrid, and my journey here is a testament to the incredible power of computers. I applied for a program, was accepted, and flew from the U.S. without any hassle. If it weren't for computers, I would still be struggling with the secretary at the International Programs Office at Boston University. The application process, likely computer-generated, ensured my information was processed efficiently. Without computers, the International Programs Office would be overwhelmed with paperwork, leading to potential misplacement or loss.\n\nBooking my flight also involved computers. Though I didn't do it myself, the transaction would have been nearly impossible without their aid. Computers have truly made our lives easier, more organized, and connected to the world in ways we couldn't have imagined before.", "speed": 0.5899011727839938, "eta": "00h05m27s"}

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.  However, this sense of reality is not so distorted, and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman.  As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality, TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "An invention of the 20th century that has significantly changed people's lives is television.

Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time.  They are a complete luxury and not a necessity.\n\tThe cellular telephone has changed people's lives in many ways: the main way being the availability to be reached at any time.  Communication is readily available in cars & on the streets now.  People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down.  They can take their cellular phones on vacations & to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call.  To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\tAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone.  When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident.  This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them.  So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them.  Cellular telephones are also very expensive. They are expensive to buy, to install and to use. Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call, it costs a lot of money.  Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone, can afford to pay the bills!\n\tThe other day I called my father in his office, from Madrid -  On his \"party line\" he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone.  I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with 4 people at once, especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car!!

Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time. They are considered a complete luxury and not a necessity. The cellular telephone has changed people's lives in many ways, primarily through the availability to be reached at any time. Communication is readily available in cars and on the streets now. People can use their cell phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down. They can take their cell phones on vacations and to their friends' houses if they are expecting an important call. To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but many people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\nAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the increased accident rate among those talking on their car phone. When someone is concentrating more on their phone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident, especially in heavy traffic. This often happens when people are not concentrating on the car in front of them. So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect. Additionally, they are very expensive. They are costly to buy, install, and use. Whether you are making a call from the cell phone or receiving a call, it costs a lot of money. While many people who can afford to buy a cell phone can also afford the bills, the expense is still significant.\n\nThe other day, I called my father in his office from Madrid.

Over the years, the question of whether American culture should maintain distinct genre identities has risen.

On the other hand, a woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children. These so called images although maybe pleasant to some people, are not always realistic. For instance a man is not always the strong backbone of the family, the culture makes him out to be. The successful business woman/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\tHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to provide both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of pressure on men, as they aspire to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become so preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them. This is clearly the case in Warren Farrell's book \"Why men are the way they 'are'\", in which Ralph admits that he worked so hard to provide for his family, that he lost touch with them.\nThe other disadvantage of having an ideal male image reflects the issue of sensitivity in men. According to William Masters a social scientist, school age boys are generally expected to show mascularity by demonstrating physical competence and bravery, and are criticized for showing fear or emotions afterall, big boys don't cry.

This coercion whether it began as a struggle for dominance between two or more ethnicities or not, has invoked stereotypes of each, causing an individual to expect a traditional cause and effect as well as a pre-sought expectation for themselves. Between the struggle of man and woman our history has broadcasted the man as being the dominant figure in a world built for both.

Ralph initially believed that joining college after dropping baseball would benefit his family financially. However, he later understood that there was no real choice; he had to become a corporate business lawyer to succeed in the legal world, never considering the broader implications (568).

The news media and many individuals have stated facts as well as opinions, I would like to express my opinion on the justness of the sentence handed down to Susan Smith.\nSusan Smith has had a very disturbing life as a child. Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty.

Most published works are about decreasing the drug use.  Drugs are here to stay whether anyone likes it or not.  It would be nearly impossible to completely eliminate all of the different drug uses.  People will always find some kind of over-the-counter drug or inhalants, to get high off of.  The legalization of some drugs like marijuana would improve many different aspects of society.\nHealth problems seem to be a concern as far as legalization goes.  Issues such as permanent damage to the brain and other parts of the anatomy.  The fact is that people are going to use drugs anyway, so why not regulate the pureness of some of these drugs.  A majority of drugs relate to or have deadly effects.  Most people do not see marijuana as a drug.  They view it like cigarettes.  Marijuana is probably one of the lease harmful of drugs.  The side effects of marijuana is not apparent as some other drugs.  I do not feel as strongly about legalizing crack cocaine as others.  There are some other things legal today, which can have potentially deadly results.  Lung cancer from cigarette smoke, liver failure from the abuse of alcohol, and the potential loss of teeth and gum damage from chewing tobacco.\n\tIf marijuana among other drugs were legalized, should there be an age limitation? If children obeyed the law, it would be a good idea.  However, they do not.  An age limit would probably just encourage kids to see if they could\nstill get drugs.

Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime.

Sex Is used to do everything. I can't remember a time when I have turned on the television and not watched a movie, with a great deal of sex in it. Some of the best shows on television, according to the ratings are shows where everyone sleeps with everyone. Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place are prime examples of overrated sex in the media. In these two shows, if everyone isn't sleeping with everyone else, then the characters are not happy. On Beverly Hills, 90210, everyone on that show has or will have slept with everyone else, by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where sex is everywhere.\nWe also have radio. Now radio is almost as bad as television. Every time I turn on the radio, I either hear a man or a woman saying how things would be alright, if you just make love. Then again some songs don't even have to be listened to, to realize they are talking about sex. \"Sex Me\", by R. Kellye, bluntly saids what the song is about. \"I'll Make Love to You\", by Boyz II Men is another obvious one. Now, these songs don't even have to be heard, just read the titles to know what the song is about. Television and radio are not the only places sex is overrated.\n\tMagazines are also in the large number of those who promote sex. \tAlmost every magazine I have ever read, has ads f eaturing sex. These ads use sex to sell everything from shampoo to cologne. In these ads we have half nude men and women, either by themselves or together promoting sex to sell something. There are these Paul Mitchell shampoo ads, which should probably show the model\u00b4s head, because all we need to see is her hair. Instead, they show a model lying down with a sheet wrapped around her body. Nothing but a sheet. Now if I'm not mistaken, shampoo is used to wash your hair not your whole body, so why show her half dressed body. \"Gravity\", a cologne for men, has ads with a man kissing on a woman, both half dressed, soak and wet on a beach. The slogan reads <*>. Now they only show a little picture of the cologne. You would miss the cologne if you didn't look hard.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Sex in the media is greatly overrated these days. Sex is used to do everything.

On Beverly Hills, 90210, characters either have or will have slept with everyone by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where sex is ubiquitous.\n\nRadio also contributes to this trend. Whenever I turn on the radio, I invariably hear messages suggesting that love and making love are the keys to happiness. Some songs even make sexual content obvious, such as \"Sex Me\" by R. Kellye and \"I'll Make Love to You\" by Boyz II Men, demonstrated by their very titles. The content of these songs doesn't need to be heard to be recognized as primarily about sex.\n\nMagazines are also rife with sexually suggestive advertisements. Almost every magazine I've read features ads that use sex to market a wide range of products, from shampoo to cologne. These ads often depict half-nude models, which is not only unnecessary but also makes the product irrelevant to the viewer.

Similarly, the \"Gravity\" cologne ad shows a semi-nude man and woman in a minimalistic setting, making the cologne barely visible. The slogan is just a small piece of text, easily missed amidst the suggestive visuals.\n\nOverall, the overuse of sex in television, radio, and magazine advertisements has made it a pervasive and often inappropriate part of entertainment and marketing.", "speed": 0.5899011727839938, "eta": "00h05m27s"}

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter.

Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems.

Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

It is a plant, and I think it should be legalized. The most political stance to take on this situation would be to say it's a drug and it should be thought of as an illegal substance. Although, that is the most political stance we all know that most politicians who set these laws up use drugs themselves. Over the last few years I've noticed a rise in the popularity of weed. My first time ever seeing weed was when I was a little kid. I didn't know exactly what it was, but I knew that it was a really odd smelling cigarette. When I got older I found out that my mom and my dad smoked weed when they were younger.\nI always told myself that even though they did it back in the 70's it still wasn't right. I am a product of the just say no age. From way back when I was in the third grade the schools have been pounding it in my head \"Just Say No\". I never gave it any thought I figured the world was set up so that if you stayed off and away from drugs you would live a better life. As I got older I realized that this was not true. The people that I know who sell marijuana had nice clothes and drove nice cars. The Columbian suppliers make millions every year. The American government officials who see and don't see make mega bucks, and most of these officials are the same guys who keep weed illegal.\nAs I got older and found out more about this mixed up world I came to realize that in european countries you can buy weed like you buy a pack of cigarettes. At first I thought this was extremely odd. In my mind weed was a drug I had seen it as a young kid but I had never actually inspected it. I didn't really know what marijuana was. Then one day I a conversation with this Jamaican man that we called Black Mosses. He explained it all to me, he told me that marijuana was natural because it was a plant that came from the earth and it could be used in it's leafy form unlike cocaine which was processed and it has impurities in it.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Marijuana is a plant, and I think it should be legalized.

Additionally, American government officials who enforce marijuana laws make substantial profits, many of whom continue to keep it illegal.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the complexities of the world, I found that European countries allow the purchase of marijuana in a manner similar to cigarettes. Initially, this seemed incredibly odd to me. While I had always viewed marijuana as a drug that I encountered as a child, I hadn't actually examined it closely.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Society has a double standard for women in our culture, which stems back from the past when women were strictly confined to the home and men were the breadwinners and heads of the household.

The concept of feminism challenged the notion that being female made women particularly weak or unintelligent. Women, just like men, possess brains and intelligence, and sex discrimination is fundamentally wrong.\n\nThe belief that women were the weaker sex led men to establish double standards in society, perpetuating inequalities that feminism aimed to dismantle.

The government year is called the fiscal year. By the end of each fiscal year the government must pass thirteen essential bills in order for the government to continue to operate. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year. This may be the most important bill because without a budget (good or bad), government employees cannot be paid. Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.\nIn many ways this division in power can be good.

This event, the shutdown of the United States government, will not end until government officials decide to work together and resolve the problem that initiated this whole ordeal. I feel that the American people elect representatives in the government to prevent such crises. When 800,000 workers, and counting, are left unemployed for reasons beyond their control, it becomes evident that the government officials are not fulfilling their duties.\n\nOctober 1st marks the end of the government's fiscal year, known as the government's political year. By the end of each fiscal year, the government must pass thirteen essential bills to continue its operations. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year. This bill is particularly crucial because without it, government employees cannot be paid. Often, government officials\u2014Congress, the President, and the President's Cabinet\u2014wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because the beginning of the next fiscal year coincides with elections, causing significant tension in the government. Around August of every year, a power struggle begins between the different political parties in office.\n\nIn many ways, this division of power can be beneficial. When a situation arises, it can bring a variety of perspectives to the table, ensuring that no single person can control the government. However, this division also brings its own challenges, as it can lead to stalemates and inefficiencies.", "speed": 0.5899011727839938, "eta": "00h05m27s"}

Who should be number 1? Who should be the national champion? These are the same questions that college football has to face every year and every year these questions seem to be getting more difficult to answer. The college football polls don't seem to have the answer to these questions because there is always some debated over who should be ranked number 1 even after the bowl games. However, college football can develop a playoff system and keep their bowl games at the same time. The simple solution to solving one of college football's most complicated situations, the selection of a national championship team, is to have a playoff system in which the top teams compete for the top spot. A playoff system will generate more revenue, create more excitement for the fans because they will be able to see some of their dream match-ups, and most importantly, it will determine a true champion and a true number 1 for college football.\nIn the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship but not without some type of argument from other fans and poll writers. Before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl with the winner earning the national title, there were some poll writers and fans arguing that it should be Florida State and Miami playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State had 1 loss in their record and that was to the Miami Hurricanes. Many poll writers and fans were saying that Florida State was arguably playing the best football in the country at the end of the regular season and they believed that Florida State should have jumped Alabama in the polls from number 3 to number 2 so that they could play Miami for the national championship. Some poll writers had a good argument that Florida State could have jumped Alabama in the polls because near the end of the regular season, Alabama struggled to the Florida Gators, a team that Florida State dismantled a week earlier. But the poll writers couldn't overlook the fact that Florida State had one loss while Alabama was still undefeated.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "College football faces the perennial questions: Who's number 1? Who's the national champion? Who should be number 1? Who should be the national champion? These questions have become increasingly complex each year.

Nevertheless, a playoff system could address this issue, maintaining bowl games while determining a true national champion. A playoff system would generate more revenue, create excitement for the fans, and ultimately establish a clear champion and number 1 team.\n\nDuring the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship. However, this decision sparked controversy among fans and poll writers before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl. The ensuing debate centered on whether Florida State and Miami should compete in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State, with only one loss in their record, was seen by many as arguably the best team of the regular season. Poll writers argued that Florida State deserved to leapfrog Alabama from number 3 to number 2, allowing them to face Miami for the national championship. Despite Alabama's undefeated status, Florida State's single loss was a significant factor in the discussion. Ultimately, the complexity of determining the true national champion persists, highlighting the need for a playoff system to resolve such debates.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

Every since the wild west, the civil war, and the drafting of the Declaration of Independance. People under the age of twenty one are considered to be minors, when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States. At eighteen you are considered a man, therefore you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions. Eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States. \n\tYou can be condemned to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen, but you can not drink a beer like all of the other adults over the age of twenty one. Kids are dieing for our country in wars, but the government will still not allow them to drink. How can you think you are a man and fight in combat, when the government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults. I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country, you should be able to feel the affects of drinking alcohol.\n\tKids are getting in too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents. Most kids\teighteen to twenty are out of high school, and their parents do not care what they do. A high school diploma should state that you are old enough to make mature decisions. You can say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not have a diploma. You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty one, then you are not able to drink. Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate, thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do anything an adult can do.\n\tThere would be less crime in the United States among teenagers, if eighteen year old was allowed to drink. Most crime among teenagers is drinking and driving. They are left with this decision to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents. They cannot drink in their own household, so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades, ever since the Wild West, the Civil War, and the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. Every since then, the legal drinking age has remained at twenty-one. However, many argue that eighteen should be the legal age for consuming alcohol in the United States. At eighteen, individuals are considered men and thus capable of making their own decisions. It seems illogical that those who are old enough to be drafted into the military can be denied the right to drink, yet are still forbidden from doing so.\n\nKids are dying in wars in the United States at the age of eighteen, while they are prohibited from consuming alcohol like other adults over twenty-one. This is perplexing: if one can hold a gun and fight for their country, should they not also be allowed to experience the effects of drinking? \n\nMany kids aged eighteen to twenty struggle to hide their drinking from their parents. Most of these teenagers are out of high school and their parents are less concerned about their actions. A high school diploma often signifies that a student is mature enough to make responsible decisions. One could argue that if a student does not have a diploma, they should not be allowed to drink. This might encourage more teenagers to pursue their education, believing that obtaining a diploma could grant them adult privileges.\n\nMoreover, legalizing the drinking age at eighteen could potentially reduce crime among teenagers. Much of the teenage crime related to alcohol is driven by the desire to hide it from their parents. If they are not allowed to drink at home, teenagers often turn to more secretive and dangerous activities. Allowing them to drink legally could provide a safer and more socially acceptable outlet.\n\nIn conclusion, while the current drinking age of twenty-one has its reasons, many believe that lowering the legal drinking age to eighteen could lead to a decrease in teenage crime and promote a healthier, more responsible approach to alcohol consumption. Considering the maturity required to serve in the military, it seems reasonable to extend this privilege to the legal drinking age.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method that should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.\nWith all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the right to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child. Why can't these women just carry out the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption. Also, some people use money as their excuse. They say they can not afford to have a child.

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that is constantly debated. These debates began over two decades ago and have grown in intensity throughout the years. The two major differing views on this subject are the primary reasons for such controversy. The central question that should be addressed is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that deals with the lives of humans.\n\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but nearly everyone forms an opinion on the topic. There are two main categories that people place themselves in: pro-choice or pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, it is challenging to determine who has sufficient knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. Therefore, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation, as she is the only one who truly understands the consequences and how much the child will suffer.\n\nPro-choicers and pro-lifers have made various arguments to support their positions for or against abortion. However, if we analyze many of these arguments, they often lack substantial evidence. For example, some anti-abortionists argue that women who have abortions are forced to give birth to unwanted babies due to rape. This perspective neglects special cases of women who are unwillingly impregnated, making the pro-lifers' argument seem unrealistic about the necessity of abortion.\n\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is the \"Slippery Nazi Slope.\" According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide, equating societies that accept abortion with the Nazis. However, this argument is not substantial when considering the true meaning of genocide, which is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial, or cultural group. This comparison oversimplifies and distorts the complex nature of abortion and its implications.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

Pink is mainly associated with women. Pink is considered a feminine color. Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are usually pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.\nCommercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, \"Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman,\" the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads have white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.\nPink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed in pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are usually dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would not want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. So if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.\nCommercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girls and Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies for girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.\nAlso baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs are also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys.

There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Over the past few years, a question has frequently appeared in courts: should women be allowed to attend the Citadel? Many people have voiced objections to this statement, while others stand firmly in support of it.\n\nWhen questioned about why women shouldn't be admitted, the two most common responses are often the same: it has traditionally been an all-male institution, and women might not be able to handle it. Yes, the Citadel has a history of enrolling only males, but as the saying goes, traditions are meant to be broken. Traditions could never have persisted if they weren't eventually revised or discarded, such as the abolition of slavery or the end of the tradition of women being confined to household duties. As society evolves, certain practices fall by the wayside, making room for new, more equitable ones.\n\nDespite the progress made, it's clear that society has not achieved complete equality. Men and women, though sharing many similarities, also differ significantly. Some women, like some men, may be strong and intelligent, while others might not. It's not fair to assume that women, as a whole, cannot handle the challenges of attending the Citadel. While some might argue that women lack the physical strength required, there are certainly women who could meet these demands. The key is that everyone deserves the opportunity to try.\n\nIn our country, if a school is publicly funded, it cannot discriminate against race, religion, gender, or people with disabilities. The Citadel, as a publicly funded institution, should not be any different. If public schools started to implement discriminatory practices, such as restricting admission based on ethnicity or nationality, it would create great chaos in our education system. This would necessitate additional resources, such as more teachers, bus drivers, janitors, and cooks, to accommodate the increased student population.\n\nIn conclusion, the Citadel, like all public schools, should follow the same principles of equality and non-discrimination. By allowing women to attend, we can move closer to a more equitable society where people are judged on their abilities and character, rather than their gender.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The debate over whether Marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and it remains a significant issue today. The widespread use of Marijuana is evident, even among prominent figures such as the president. Recently, many politicians have discussed the potential legalization of Marijuana, but it appears that without overwhelming public support, there will be no major changes to the laws regarding Marijuana. This passage aims to inform readers about all the facts about Marijuana, recognizing that every American has the right to make their own decisions regarding government policies. However, choices are often based on ignorance or preconceptions. While choosing to make Marijuana illegal is not inherently wrong, it should be based on justifiable reasons.\n\nTo understand the debate fully, it's essential to look at the history of Marijuana in the United States.

In 1988, the DEA concluded that Marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substances known to man. Despite this, over 400,000 people in the U.S. are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\n\nAnother critical aspect to consider is the physical effects of smoking Marijuana. Short-term effects include the \"high,\" increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long-term effects are similar to those of cigarette smoking, such as mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Chronic smokers, who smoke more than once a day, may experience short-term memory loss after smoking.\n\nAfter examining the physical effects, we must also look at the mental effects of Marijuana. According to \"Psychology and You\" by McMahon and Romano, \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug occasionally.\"\n\nBy understanding both the historical context and the physical and mental effects of Marijuana, readers can make more informed decisions about the legalization debate.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

Not only does it paint a colorful picture of the many people that share this country, it also shows us the many different aspects of the cultures around the world. Ethnic American literature ultimately opens our eyes to what is around us. Therefore, as a direct answer to the question <*>, I concur. Not only should we study it it should be given as an entirely seperate discipline. Joseph Zaitchik, editor of Face to Face, 1994, states that <*>. However my question is how will we learn about cultures in America if close our eyes to the violence, conflict, or confrontation? All literature should bring us closer to our surroundings.\nAlthough there is some violence in ethnic American literature it should not be the only focus, because some classics contain violence and that was somehow overlooked. The themes that ethnic American literature focuses on are hope, cultural traditions, and the struggles of the characters which is common in most works. For example, Alice Walker's The Color Purple is brutally violent, but under the surface one notices and finds that Celie struggles to survive as a woman, a wife, and a mother but ultimately struggles to survive as an individual.

Many ethnic American writers, use violence in their novels as a way to emphasize their points. One great example is Esquivel's novel Like Water for Chocolate. The novel is filled with magic-making, the violence or love scenes spectacular. Therefore it diminishes the violence and the reader focuses on the true themes of the novel.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Ethnic American literature is an integral, if not necessary part of American society today. Not only does it paint a colorful picture of the many people that share this country, but it also shows us the many different aspects of the cultures around the world. Ethnic American literature ultimately opens our eyes to what is around us. Therefore, as a direct answer to the question, I concur that it should be studied and potentially given as an entirely separate discipline. Joseph Zaitchik, editor of Face to Face, 1994, states that literature has a profound impact on our understanding of cultures, even those within our own nation. However, my question remains: how will we learn about cultures in America if we overlook the violence, conflict, or confrontation? All literature should bring us closer to our surroundings.\n\nAlthough there is some violence in ethnic American literature, it should not be the only focus. Many classics contain violence, and this was sometimes overlooked. The themes that ethnic American literature focuses on, such as hope, cultural traditions, and the struggles of the characters, are common in most works. For example, Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple\" is brutally violent, but under the surface, one notices and finds that Celie struggles to survive as a woman, a wife, and a mother but ultimately struggles to survive as an individual. We learn about the ways of African-American culture; we initially denounce it, then we learn to accept it, and finally, we understand it. The same is true for Toni Morrison's novel \"Jazz.\" Although it takes place in the heart of Harlem and violence is a predominant occurrence, the reader looks deeper and finds a stimulating story about lost love, inner-city conflicts, and again the struggles of survival.

One great example is Esquivel's novel \"Like Water for Chocolate.\" The novel is filled with magic-making, and the violence or love scenes are spectacular. Therefore, it diminishes the violence, and the reader focuses on the true themes of the novel.\n\nIn conclusion, while ethnic American literature does contain violence, it also delves deeply into themes that are essential for understanding and appreciating the diverse cultures within American society. By exploring these works, we can gain a richer understanding of the experiences and struggles that shape the lives of many individuals in our country.", "speed": 0.5273348563439825, "eta": "00h05m05s"}

The transmission of culture is a very important aspect of ethnic American literature. Many ethnic American writers show the importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native country.\nMany of the novels we have read this semester show this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. The mothers want to desperately hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters \"the Chinese way\". They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are. Where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues. The daughters find this hard to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions - the doors for transmition of culture have been opened. Amy Tan's novel ends with this important aspect of ethnic literature. Another novel that shows transmition of culture is Walker's The Color Purple. Celie's sister Nettie goes off to Africa as a missionary. Once there she tries to transmit African-American culture to the natives.

For example, Amy Tan's \"The Joy Luck Club\" prominently features the desire of the mothers to hold on to the old ways of China and raise their daughters \"the Chinese way.\" The mothers share stories of China with their daughters, aiming to convey information about their heritage\u2014where they came from, who they are, and why they act in certain ways regarding specific issues. The daughters, however, find it challenging to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel, all the daughters come to understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions, thus opening the doors for the transmission of culture. Amy Tan's novel concludes with this significant aspect of ethnic literature.\n\nAnother novel that illustrates the transmission of culture is Alice Walker's \"The Color Purple.\" Celie's sister Nettie travels to Africa as a missionary and attempts to transmit African-American culture to the natives. Additionally, in Laura Esquivel's \"Like Water for Chocolate,\" Mama Elena tries to transmit culture to Tita and her other daughters.

Although such a show of strength by these works' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author, it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.\n\nIn the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mother's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show. This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature cannot be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In many of the minority works of modern literature, there can be an emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces.

The Oreillon girls and the monkeys are exotic lore, and the girls become very upset when Candide kills the monkeys, their lovers. While Candide could be an exotic romance, it is something else. The French Acad\u00e9mie's rules on subject matter stipulate that there should be no sex, violence, attacks on the state, or attacks on religion. Candide, however, is a parody of these rules as Voltaire attacks all of them.\n\nVoltaire makes many attacks on religion and the state. He picks on everywhere Candide goes except Eldorado. In Lisbon, the wise men decide to hold a grand auto-da-f\u00e9, believing that the sight of a few people being slowly burned would stop the earth from shaking. A tragic incident outside Surinam sees a black man lying on the ground, with his hand and leg severed after getting caught in a sugar mill and trying to escape. In England, an Admiral is killed because he failed to execute enough people. In Paris, Martin is robbed and then arrested for being a thief. Voltaire also attacks religion by highlighting the tragic fate of James the Anabaptist, who drowned while trying to save a sailor during a shipwreck. Candide kills the Jew and the Grand Inquisitor over a dispute with Cun\u00e9gonde, resulting in their deaths, which is an isolated incident among many. The Old Woman, the daughter of a Pope, had the worst life of all, reflecting the harsh realities beyond Eldorado. These critiques of society and religion underscore Voltaire's intention to challenge and satirize the status quo.", "speed": 0.5650315487392563, "eta": "00h03m48s"}

In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin.

The statistics in South Carolina support Lunde's thesis.The majority of the murders in SC are committed by friends, relatives, neighbors, or someone the victim knew. The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around. For example, a guy may get mad at his brother and then pick up a gun in a threatening-type way. He may have no intention of using it. But, as Berkowitz states the <*>. In his aggressive rage, he may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to the death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years. Various races are becoming more and more acceptable. However, racial prejudice is seen today in medical research. Certain studies are carried out on people of one race. Therefore, the research results may not be correct for all people.

Frustration and aggression are often implicated in these tragedies. A person may get mad at another and become frustrated, wishing to express this frustration through aggression. This aggression can escalate to violence, especially when a gun is readily available. For instance, a person might get angry at a sibling and pick up a gun in a threatening manner. Although they may not intend to harm, their aggression could lead to an unintended fatal outcome, echoing Berkowitz's findings.\n\nThe high number of tragedies is further exacerbated by the widespread availability of guns. This accessibility can tragically turn a minor altercation into a fatal incident, even among children who may not fully grasp the lethality of firearms.\n\nRacial prejudice still exists today, albeit in evolved forms. Aversive racism, where individuals avoid associating with certain minorities to suppress their prejudices, is one such form. Another emerging prejudice is symbolic racism, where individuals equate specific groups with social problems. For instance, many people erroneously associate welfare recipients predominantly with black individuals, viewing them as lazy and unwilling to work, despite the fact that most welfare recipients are white.\n\nIn recent decades, racial acceptance has increased, but racial prejudice persists in medical research. Studies often focus on people from a single race, which may lead to inaccurate or non-representative results.

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "According to Lunde, an incredible 90% of homicides involve individuals who knew each other previously.

Domestic disputes often en in tragedy, but only because one person doesn't think the other will actually shoot them, likewise the person with the gun really doesn't want to kill the other, only even the scales. But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger.

The media also plays a part in this flippancy. When a character is shot, he often appears in the next scene. Kids, in particular, aren't forming realistic schemas regarding violence. The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes leading to more rapes. We as potential parents must instill in our children - the future presidents, doctors, teachers, & even murders - a true picture of aggression & the need to control it.\nRacial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago. It is actually appearing to decline. This is evidenced in, for example, cartoons and t.v. shows - racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped. Attitudes regarding desegregation have also changed - perhaps as a result of the psychology of inevitably & cognitive dissonance. Perhaps through the media & other sources some misconceptions are being cleared up and more realistic information is being provided to the public.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "According to Lunde, 85% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know, a statistic that is supported by data from the South Carolina Department of Statistics (SC). These tragedies highlight the intense frustration that can overwhelm the human body and lead to loss of control. People who commit murders often did not intend to kill from the outset; instead, their frustration escalated into anger and aggression, culminating in violent actions. Even minor obstacles, such as someone getting in the way of one's goals, can trigger frustration that spirals into aggressive behavior, sometimes resulting in murder. These incidents also underscore the dangerous level of desensitization to violence that can exist in America. The media contributes to this desensitization by frequently depicting scenes of violence, such as characters being shot and then appearing in subsequent scenes. This continual exposure can distort children's understanding of violence, making them less likely to form realistic perceptions. Furthermore, media exposure can desensitize men to sex crimes, potentially leading to an increase in such incidents. As potential parents, it is crucial to teach our children\u2014who will become future leaders, doctors, teachers, and possibly even perpetrators\u2014a true understanding of aggression and the importance of controlling it.\n\nRacial prejudice, while still present, appears to be declining, as evidenced by changes in media representation and public attitudes. Cartoons and television shows now avoid public stereotypes of racial minorities. Attitudes toward desegregation have also shifted, possibly due to the psychology of inevitability and cognitive dissonance. Through media and other sources, misconceptions are being dispelled, and more realistic information is being disseminated to the public.", "speed": 0.5650315487392563, "eta": "00h03m48s"}

The statistics do support Lunde b/c about 90% of murders in S.C. are committed by an aquantiance. Usually these murders occur due to a disagreement between the victim & the murderer.

When the borrower didn't have it they got into a fight & the friend who borrowed the $10 was dead. A similar incident occured between 2 brother. One asked his dad to borrow the car for a date & the other brother asked his mom to borrow the car. When it was time for the brother to go on the date, he found his brother getting into the car. They got into an argument & the brother w/ the date got a gun out of the glove compartment & shot his brother dead.\nToday racial prejudice is more hidden than it was 30 yrs ago. For instance, Dr Frey used an example on the test & in class that said he knew of people in Clinton who were all for minority rights, but they just didn't want them (blacks or other minorities) living next to them.

It is, no doubt, a fast way of commuting to and from destinations with little stress on the body, however traffic congestion is becoming a major concern in any city or town. It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it was before. Lancaster is a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.\nAlong with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared to give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common in the major American cities and even, at times, London.\nWith such are large no. of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. \u00a3 billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in as best a condition as possible.\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with he number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress which can again be due to traffic congestion.\nAll of these problems, one way or another, can all be linked with congestion and hence the number of cars on the road. To attempt to lessen this number, I have a number of solutions.\n1. Park and Ride - have cars outside of town and catch a free/cheap bus into town.\n2. Improvent of public transport - Cheaper fares, cleaner, more pleasant environment to encourage them to leave their cars at home.\n3.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The myriad problems facing road transport are numerous and carry potentially severe penalties.

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic.

Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly.

Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorries around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the road-haulage lobby on the government.

It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to \"fill in the gaps\". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors. We are simply running out of room to build new roads.\nOne of the main side effects of road travel in particular is pollution. Acid rain, asthma and many other problems are rife and soon the fuels for these cars will be running out. Gas buses and gars is really only a short term solution and a renewable source must be found. But with petrol companies unwilling to investigate water and alcohol powered cars for fear of losing petrol sales these still seem a long way off as our everyday form of transport.\nSolutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The United Kingdom, a small island with a population of around 55 million, is experiencing significant overpopulation. This has led to an inadequate and expensive public transport system, forcing more and more cars onto the road. As a result, Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world, and current modern traffic policies are insufficient to address this problem. In short, a somewhat more radical and unpopular policy is required.\n\nBritish rail is notoriously slow, late, and expensive. The excitement of rail travel and steam trains has long since faded, with many old tracks being dismantled. To alleviate the congestion on Britain's roads, it is essential to encourage more rail travel. Opening new lines rather than closing old ones could help. Although the privatisation of British Rail might produce a more competitive service, there is a fear that it will lead to the closure of smaller, less profitable lines, improving only the main routes. The question remains: why is British rail so unreliable? Many other countries, including developing ones, run reliable services, and few efforts have been made to make fares cheaper and rail travel more appealing for families.\n\nUntil the rail service improves, people will continue to rely on the increasingly clogged roads. Simply widening and building new roads will not solve the problem, as the number of cars will continue to rise to fill the gaps. The recent halt of work on the Newbury bypass for three days highlights the growing frustration with road congestion. We are running out of room to build new roads.\n\nOne of the main consequences of road travel is pollution. Issues such as acid rain and asthma are now common, and soon we may run out of resources to fuel these cars. While gas buses and gas stations are only a short-term solution, a renewable source must be found. However, petrol companies' reluctance to invest in alternative fuels like water and alcohol, fearing loss of petrol sales, makes these options seem distant as our primary form of transport.\n\nIn conclusion, the solutions for these problems in Britain have been unimaginative and largely unsuccessful. A more radical approach to improving public transportation and addressing road congestion is necessary to create a sustainable and efficient future for the country's transportation system.", "speed": 0.5650315487392563, "eta": "00h03m48s"}

The essay will have four sections too it. Firstly the main problems of road transport will be identified and this shall be followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate. \nRoad transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room. Away from cities road construction faces the problem of geographical sites.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Before starting any essay, it is crucial to define and understand the key words in the essay title. \"Main Problems\" refers to those issues that significantly concern road and rail transport operators. The essay will be divided into four sections. Firstly, the main problems of road transport will be identified, followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be applied to rail transport, emphasizing that their problems are distinct in most respects, requiring separate arguments. Road transport encompasses a wide range of vehicles, from bicycles to coaches, all carrying passengers along various roads to their destinations. The primary issue with road transport as a route is its limited capacity to hold vehicles simultaneously, leading to ever-increasing congestion on most British roads, whether they are motorways or 'A' roads. While country lanes and small 'B' roads are excluded from this discussion, the focus remains on urban roads.\n\nTraffic jams are becoming more prevalent due to two main reasons: the sheer number of cars on the road and poor planning of road systems that did not foresee such levels of congestion. One potential solution has been the installation of one-way systems in many cities, allowing for better route planning. The problem lies in too many vehicles trying to use the same roads simultaneously. For instance, 'A' roads leading into city centers are heavily congested during rush hours, typically between seven to nine in the morning and four to six in the evening. Motorways also experience peak-time congestion during holiday seasons. Another significant issue is the limited ability to build new roads. Increasing numbers of protesters and environmentalists are blocking construction sites, such as the Dwyford Downs, which is not a major problem. However, new roads are most needed in densely populated city centers where space is limited. Away from cities, road construction faces geographical challenges, further complicating the situation.", "speed": 0.5650315487392563, "eta": "00h03m48s"}

Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There are many problems facing both road and rail transport in the UK.

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six.

If every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselves in a 10-mile tail-back, why do we still insist on traveling in such a manner? To illustrate my point, if every time you took a train, it stopped for 2 hours on the track, everyone would stop taking it. So why do we still insist on traveling on the road?\n\nThe answer most likely lies in two areas. First, many westerners hold the attitude that \"it is their right to travel in such a manner.\" This shows considerable ignorance. I am far from being a 'greenie' who wants everyone to live in tepees and eat soya bean soup, but I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic on our roads today.\n\nThe government's answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads is to back off; they are not even attempting to treat the cause. As a result, more and more people are now driving. We all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road. Why? Do we, the western world (5% of the population of the world), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost just because we can't be bothered to get out of bed a bit earlier to catch public transport? Even if we did, then soon enough the rest of the world will too.

This has only exacerbated the traffic problem, creating a vicious cycle of increasing road traffic and decreasing public transportation options.", "speed": 0.5149621639513815, "eta": "00h03m08s"}

Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.\nIt is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls at the first hurdle. With this system any madman can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.\nThere is no fair and perfect way to run a country.

The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits.

Imagining the suffering of foxes during these hunts is deeply upsetting, and I firmly believe that banning fox hunting is necessary.\n\nFoxes are not essential to controlling the rabbit population, as farmers can effectively use poisons to manage rabbits.

Yet this assertion is clearly hypocritical. Times and attitudes change, and in some cases, that means obliterating tradition. Firstly, fox hunting is a cruel sport that shows no remorse or kindness towards animals. It involves a poor, defenseless fox being chased down to death by a pack of 10 or more bloodhounds, and upwards of 10 people on horseback with rifles. In the average situation, the fox has absolutely no chance. It can run for its life, and sometimes escape, but usually it is just delaying the inevitable. How can a 20-on-1 chase be seen as fair or good sport, as another argument suggests? I find it beyond comprehension.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that they can mount the fox back at home, but most times the fox is so damaged by the gunshot wound that only its head can be mountable. It is such a waste to see these beautiful creatures hung up on walls for show when their numbers are dwindling. The idea raises disgust from other countries and in some places is laughable. Why do we British cling to this cruel and heartless exercise?\n\nI wonder if the people who partake in this sport would like to be chased down by bloodhounds and people with guns, while they themselves are unarmed.

Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing. Although throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side, should boxing be banned?\nEvery time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull. This causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage. In my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing.\nThe sport to say the least is actually a blood sport, the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to 'knock your opposition out', although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form, he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points. \nBut there is one exception - the original example, the first reference why boxing should be banned, the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank (the man who doesn't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out).\nThis example only proves too well what a dangerous so called 'sport' boxing is.\nThe boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the 'spot' safer having rungside doctors, banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage.\n<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Two men, one ring, only one can leave. This dramatic premise is at the core of boxing, although rules have been introduced over the years to mitigate its more brutal aspects. The question remains: Should boxing be banned?\n\nEvery time a boxer takes a punch to the head, his brain vigorously hits the inside of his skull. This can lead to the loss of numerous brain cells per fight, and if this occurs frequently, it can result in brain damage, effectively ending a boxer's career. Many, including myself, believe this is a compelling reason for banning boxing.\n\nDespite its violent nature, some argue that boxing is more than a blood sport. Chris Eubank, for instance, views himself as a sportsman and believes that boxing is an art form. He insists that he does not enter the ring solely to knock out his opponent but to win on points and earn respect. Most of his fights have been won by points, supporting his view. However, one tragic incident stands out: Michael Watson, who was put into a coma by Chris Eubank, the very man who argues that boxing is an art, not a fight to the finish. This example starkly highlights the inherent dangers of boxing.\n\nThe boxing federation has made efforts to make the sport safer, such as having ring-side doctors and banning bare-knuckle fights. However, the primary issue remains that any blow to the head can cause significant damage, regardless of these measures. Therefore, the debate over whether boxing should remain legal or be banned continues, largely due to its dangerous consequences.", "speed": 0.5149621639513815, "eta": "00h03m08s"}

During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.\nThe brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.\nAnother aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.\nThe major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it.

This century it's popularity has increased greatly, due on part to the personalities of such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.\nHowever there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in the ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of \"Prince\" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.\nThis apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport. When this behaviour is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.\nWhilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as other sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Boxing has existed in its popular form from the last century and has taken significant steps of development since its early days of backstreet bare-knuckle fights.

When this behavior is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, one begins to see the merit in their arguments. While such behavior cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers, like other sportsmen, are aware of the risks of their chosen profession. When Jim Murray died, calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few called for the banning of motor racing. Instead, people focused on new rules for the car's bodywork. Both sportsmen realized the risks they were taking when they set out in their chosen professions and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\n\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the banning of boxing is what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground, which would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.", "speed": 0.5149621639513815, "eta": "00h03m08s"}

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed.

Especially considering that traditional non-gamblers are now gambling on a bet with odds of 14 million to one.\n\nPrior to the Lottery's implementation, no one knew where all these profits were going to go. It is now clear that the majority of the profits have gone straight into Camelot's pockets. If the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering that Virgin was prepared to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise, and giving all the profits to the government.", "speed": 0.5149621639513815, "eta": "00h03m08s"}

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points.

Some people have become millionaires overnight because their numbers have been picked out. However, before the first draw was made, heated debate centred around the fact that should the National Lottery even exist?\nDuring the debate many interested parties stated their objections to the National Lottery. One of Britain's most famous businesses and Families had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies and Littlewards, in particular, were particularly worried about the start of the National Lottery. They were worried that people instead of spending money on the 'pools', would stake a \u00a31 on the National Lottery instead. This was a major part of their argument, that the National Lottery would take their business away and due to this they would have no need to employ as many workers, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, already an unemployment problem spot.\nCharities were worried that they would lose out. They had been promised a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) going to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon. Clubs and charities who sold scratch cards as a source of income were worried because they thought nobody would buy their cards. They could not offer large money prizes like the Lottery. More worries were expressed when the Lottery's own scratch cards were introduced, possibly meaning even less money for charities.\nLarge debate centred around which organisations stood to benefit from the profits made by the Lottery. Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed. Sports teams, clubs, social groups and communities applied for cash for new facilities and then John Major announced some profits would be used for the construction of a British Academy of Sport.

They had been promised a share of the profits, amounting to approximately 40p of every pound spent. However, calculations indicated that charities would likely be disadvantaged, as the introduction of the lottery could reduce the funds collected through scratch card sales\u2014a significant source of income for charitable organizations. Additionally, charities were concerned that their scratch cards, which could not offer large cash prizes, would be less appealing to customers, further diminishing their revenue.\n\nThe debate also centered on which organizations would benefit from the lottery's profits. Charities expected a fair share, but several other groups expressed interest in receiving funds. Applications were submitted to the National Heritage Office, with proposals to allocate money toward building monuments commemorating the millennium's start. While many people supported this idea, they opposed the construction of unnecessary 'White Elephants.'\n\nSports teams, clubs, social groups, and communities also applied for cash to fund new facilities.

It is a mass produced, user friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes which you are encouraged to do by the government. It has been calle 'the tax for the poor' as inevitably the people who have least will want to win most and waste money they can not afford to. However it is so popular that the party which removes it will be the most unpopular that has been. There are many groups who are campaigning against the lottery. The most promentant of these are the church and many charity groups. The churches main arguement is that it is causing misery to thousands of people. Those who have been come addicted and have spent every thing they own on it and those who don't have enough money to feed themselves even before they waste there money on odds of illions to one which any regular gambler knows are not worth a second look. The church and charities also argue that they are loosing money  which they so desperately need to help millions of over the world as oppose to the one person who recieves millioins each week.

The company running the National Lottery, Camelot, is trying to maintain the illusion of excitement by increasing the jackpot to 40 million and introducing instant-win games. Their extensive advertising campaign and even their name, the fabled home of King Arthur, are all part of their strategy to entice people who barely have enough money to live on to spend it in search of their fortune. Almost weekly, there are stories of people going bankrupt just trying to win. It is a mass-produced, user-friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes, which the government encourages people to engage in. It has been called \"the tax for the poor,\" as inevitably, those who have the least will want to win the most and waste money they cannot afford. Nevertheless, its popularity is so widespread that the party proposing its removal would be the most unpopular that has been.\n\nMany groups are campaigning against the Lottery, with the church and many charity organizations being the most prominent opponents. The main argument from the churches is that it causes misery to thousands of people. Those who become addicted and spend every penny they own on it, and those who don't have enough money to feed themselves, are examples of the negative impact. The church and charity groups also argue that they are losing money they desperately need to help millions of people worldwide, as opposed to the one person who receives millions each week. While the Lottery does contribute a small proportion of its earnings to charity, international charities that save millions each year would receive less money than a school wanting a new sports hall.", "speed": 0.6235182213997287, "eta": "00h01m44s"}

Provide only the final essay.\n\nI think that it is possible to argue that the computer has made us both use and not use our brain more for a number of reasons.\n\tFirstly you could see that the introduction of computers has made us think more because of all the programmes used on them. It can take quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).\n\tIt is possible to say that using computers do not stop us using our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After all somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.\n\tPeople claim that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping your finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\tDespite computers saving time, they do everything for you at the touch of a button, solve the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This is why it could be said we don't use our brains as much.\n\tFrom simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. In the control room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. I cannot see much brain power needed for that.\n\tComputers can communiate with each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "I believe that the computer has made us both use and not use our brains for various reasons. To begin with, the introduction of computers has made us think more due to the numerous programs we use on them. Learning how to use these programs can take quite some time. Furthermore, once a program or computer is introduced, it quickly becomes outdated as people are thinking about how to improve it. It is important to remember that computers cannot replace the human brain (not yet, at least).\n\nOn the other hand, using computers does not necessarily stop us from using our brains; instead, they serve as quick and efficient time savers. For instance, someone is undoubtedly relieved to use a word processing program rather than struggle with an old-fashioned typewriter. Imagine the frustration of making a mistake while writing an important letter with a typewriter\u2014yes, you would have to start again. In contrast, with a computer, making a mistake is much easier to correct.\n\nSome people claim that computer games do not require a brain to be played. However, certain games are so challenging that people worldwide collaborate on how to solve them. They communicate through computers, which is a quicker and more efficient method than traditional means. While some games might require only pressing a button, others demand significant brainpower and strategic thinking, thereby engaging our brains in ways that simpler games do not.\n\nDespite the benefits of computers in saving time, they also do everything for us with just a touch of a button. They solve difficult sums, check spelling errors, and handle various other tasks. This convenience can lead to us relying less on our brains for mundane tasks.\n\nFrom simple homework assignments to the complex operations of running a nuclear power station like Heysham's, computers handle much of the work. For instance, at Heysham's Nuclear Power Station, a single man operates the facility, assisted by millions of pounds' worth of computers. This situation makes it hard to see the need for much brain power.\n\nMoreover, computers are capable of communicating with each other, flying planes, building cars, and even running a country. Thus, while they undoubtedly save time and make life easier, they also influence how we use our brains by handling tasks that would otherwise require significant mental effort.", "speed": 0.6235182213997287, "eta": "00h01m44s"}

Yet there are many situations where humans can travel through on foot that wheeled vehicles cannot cope, as any wheel-chair bound person would testify. The computer is a tool to be used to aid human brains and bodies, but does not (yet) come close to making them redundant.\n\tRecently, a fuss was made in the newspapers over falling ability at mental arithmetic in schoolchildren.

It is in my view therefore that it is press blowing the situation out of all proportions that will be the down fall of beef in the U.K. It was not long ago that the press anounced a killer bug eating people alive, thus catching the attention of the U.K. When the press got bored of this story, the bug dissappeared and with it peoples worries about its effects.

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products.

This shift could potentially lower beef prices as the market adjusts, possibly leading consumers to take the minimal risk of purchasing beef instead of opting for more expensive alternatives.

The rise of vegetarianism.\ni.) BSE is a disease that has been around for some time now in many forms. It affects sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE) and humans (CJD). All of these diseases are similar in progression and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are called <?>, or protein fragments, and are tiny non-living infectious particles. They must be actively taken in by an animal (i.e. they must be eaten) to have any effect. They are very resilient to heat and so cooking possibly infected food does not help. When BSE was first publicised in the mass media several years ago, there was a huge outcry: - people were worried that they would catch the human form of the disease and so experts were brought in to calm people down. After a while, as often happens, people largely forgot about BSE, but it didn't go away. The problem was that increasing numbers of herd animals were having to be destroyed as they displayed BSC symptoms. However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?\" The government reply was along lines of: \"Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten,\" i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then a recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country. The government strenuously denied this, making matters worse, and as nobody knows the real situation or even if CJD can be caught from eating infected beef, many people would seem unwilling to take the risk. The recent headlines made by small isolated numbers of deaths from CJD have not helped either.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The people of the U.K. appear to be shifting away from eating beef, and I believe there are two main reasons for this trend: i.) the BSE problem and ii.) the rise of vegetarianism.\n\ni.) BSE, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, has been a disease affecting sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE), and humans (CJD) for some time. All three diseases progress similarly, likely due to the same infectious agents, known as prions, which are tiny non-living infectious particles. To cause harm, these prions must be actively ingested by an animal. They are incredibly resilient to heat, meaning cooking affected food does not eliminate the risk. When BSE first surfaced in the media years ago, there was significant public concern about the potential for humans to contract the disease. Experts were brought in to reassure the public, but as time passed, the urgency faded, yet the issue persisted. Consequently, increasing numbers of herd animals exhibited symptoms of BSE and had to be destroyed. Symptoms, however, may not manifest for years after the disease's onset, leading to the question: \"If there are no symptoms, how can we be certain that infected animals aren't contaminating the food supply?\" In response, the government claimed that safety precautions were sufficient to prevent infected beef from entering the food chain, a response that was vague and only heightened suspicion. A recent TV documentary later revealed that not only were infected animals being sent for slaughter, but also that safety measures were inadequate, and BSE-contaminated meat was being distributed nationwide. The government's denial of these findings exacerbated the situation, leaving the public unsure and hesitant to take the risk. Further complicating matters, recent media attention on isolated cases of CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) has not alleviated public concern.\n\nii.) Concurrently, the rise of vegetarianism also contributes to the declining beef consumption in the U.K. More individuals are adopting plant-based diets, influenced by health, ethical, and environmental reasons. As a result, the demand for beef has decreased, complementing the apprehension surrounding BSE. Together, these factors have led to a noticeable shift in eating habits away from beef consumption among the U.K. population.", "speed": 0.6235182213997287, "eta": "00h01m44s"}

It is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years. As a result, some public attitudes are: \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\" Another public attitude is to ignore warnings, as there have not been any victims. However, the most popular option is to be safe and quit eating beef entirely. Consequently, more and more families have opted for chicken, pork, or lamb as an alternative. It could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry if there comes a point where supply outweighs demand, leading farmers to produce less beef and make less money. It is therefore conceivable that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product.", "speed": 0.6235182213997287, "eta": "00h01m44s"}

This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.\nThe reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.\nIf these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers this would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and know nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.\nI personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government.

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "In Vitro fertilisation, commonly known as IVF, involves the fertilisation of an egg outside the body, in a laboratory setting. The egg is retrieved from the mother and placed in an environment designed to optimise the chances of fertilisation by sperm from the father. Once fertilisation occurs, the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mother's womb, kickstarting a normal pregnancy. Typically, more than one egg is retrieved from the mother to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and, in some cases, to produce multiple births such as twins or triplets.\n\nHowever, IVF is not without controversy. Some people argue that it is not natural, suggesting that life should only begin at the moment of conception. These individuals bring up ethical concerns, questioning who should receive the treatment, at what age it should be administered, and whether the significant costs associated with IVF could be better spent on life-saving measures, such as vaccinations against diseases like measles.\n\nProponents of IVF counter these arguments by stating that individuals have the right to decide if and when they want to have children. They highlight that IVF offers hope to women who, due to medical conditions like blocked fallopian tubes, might otherwise be unable to conceive. However, they also acknowledge the necessity for ethical considerations and regulations in the rapidly advancing field of reproductive technology.\n\nIn light of these advancements, it is crucial to establish certain guidelines to ensure ethical practices. One proposed regulation is that fertility treatments should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is a biological indicator that a woman is no longer capable of bearing children. A notable case from last year involved a post-menopausal woman who obtained IVF by lying about her age, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, while IVF provides valuable options for those struggling to conceive, it is essential to balance these benefits with ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks to guide its use responsibly.", "speed": 0.6235182213997287, "eta": "00h01m44s"}

This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected.

Many new things have been invented, and many things medically have changed. Today, people can undergo liver, heart, and even lung transplants, despite the complications that may arise, many of which are successful. Additionally, individuals lacking sufficient blood supplies or white cells can receive whole new blood supplies or bone marrow transplants, respectively. All these procedures are performed on living people, but today, biological operations can also be carried out on humans who are not yet born.\n\nIn modern medicine, the process known as 'in vitro fertilisation' (IVF) enables the conception of a baby with remarkable precision. This technique involves removing an egg from a woman and placing it in a test tube. Sperm is then introduced to the test tube, and fertilization occurs as the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is incubated for several weeks until the embryo forms. Once the embryo is sufficiently developed, it is implanted back into the mother, allowing the fetus to grow naturally. This procedure is especially beneficial for married couples who have been unsuccessful in conceiving naturally, as it enables the baby to grow inside the mother's womb, fostering a deep bond that would not be possible through adoption. However, I have ethical concerns regarding post-menopausal women choosing IVF, as nature has indicated that they are too old to conceive. This can place an unfair burden on the child, who may grow up with a parent much older than their peers. Additionally, there is the possibility that the mother may not live long enough to see the child mature, which could be distressing for the child.\n\nAs the embryo begins its life in a test tube and the sperm is selected, it becomes possible to choose the sex of the embryo through genetic techniques.

In vitro ie. in a natural environment.\nThis gives couples who could not naturally have children the ability to have their own family without adopting.\na) Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women enables parents to start a family later in life. This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged to have children for her partner. Having a child is stressful at any age but if the mother is older when the child very young she may not have the energy to get up four times every night etc.\n\tTherefore, although I agree with fertility treatment for post menopausal women I think that upper age limits should be applied. Also, I think the women should have a form of councelling before hand so that they are aware of how much more stressful it is to bring up children later in life.\nb) Sex Selection.\n\tThis form of genetic engineering allows the parents to choose their own child.

This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the parents may find it hard to love the child.

If it becomes acceptable to select traits like eye color and hair color, society could experience significant demographic changes. Moreover, if the process fails and the wrong gender is conceived, parents may struggle to love the child.

The research in the last decade or so has made unbelievable progress at every turn, not all of it 'morally viable', so to speak. The theory that scientists should take responsibility for their work and its consequences is an interesting idea but there is one basic function of human psychology that makes this hypothesis invalid; when an individual scientist is working on research they are almost always working under sponsorship or directly working for a company. This means that any responsibility he/she may feel for his/her actions is shifted to their employers/sponsors. This effect has been studied for many years and several well-documented experiments show the effect clearly. It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face. Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in ww2 again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentration camps and saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sense of immediacy of the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.\n\tThis is all very interesting you may say, but these geneticists must feel some moral obligation. The actual work of genetic engineering is constantly coming up for discussion in today's media world and the work of many leading laboratories has been recognised as useful and moralistic. For example the production of insulin by genetic engineering is undoubtedly a laudable use of scientific knowledge, also the production of high yield crops for third world countries, another useful facet of genetic control. But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound? For example the high yield crops; they do indeed give many times the harvest of a normal variety yet several leach the soil, require very careful use of oil based fertilisers and countless other minor adjustments. Are these plants morally reprehensible because they require greater care and nurturing than their hardier cousins?<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The world of genetic engineering is a fiercely competitive and rapidly expanding area of science, where the research in the last decade or so has made unbelievable progress at every turn, not all of it considered 'morally viable,' to say the least.

Eventually it will be possible to eliminate genetically in herited diseases such as haemophillia and cistic fibrosis. This will be done by mapping the entire human genome. This will enable scientists to know precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.\n\tGenetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids for circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.\n\tGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a very simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need.\n\tCrops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to draught, pests and disease.\n\tIn the future it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. This is immoral as superhumans would be created for specific jobs for example huge men with lots of muscle small heads and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or for boxing.\n\tScientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal. This should not include mental ability as this would also be immoral. Genetic manipulation should not be used to change normal humans into superhumans.\n\tIt must be scientists to bear the burden as these are the people who have the knowledge to create the superhumans.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "Genetic manipulation holds great promise for the future, offering the potential to eliminate genetically inherited diseases such as hemophilia and cystic fibrosis. By mapping the entire human genome, scientists can precisely understand the function of each gene. With this knowledge, it may be possible to detect and replace defective genes in fetuses with normal ones, paving the way for a healthier future.\n\nToday, genetic engineering is used to produce essential substances, such as insulin, by inserting the human gene for insulin production into plasmids found in bacteria. These bacteria, containing the insulin gene along with an antibiotic resistance gene, are left to reproduce, producing insulin continuously. This method is superior to extracting insulin from cow livers, offering a more efficient treatment for diabetic patients.\n\nGenetic manipulation has also revolutionized food production. Selective breeding, a simple example of genetic manipulation, has been employed to produce cows with higher milk yields by breeding those with a genetic defect over many generations. Similarly, crops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to drought, pests, and diseases.\n\nHowever, the potential to alter human physical and mental abilities raises significant ethical concerns. The creation of superhumans for specific jobs, such as powerful fighters or athletes, is considered immoral. To prevent this, it is crucial to establish controls over genetic engineering and manipulation, ensuring they are used to help disadvantaged individuals achieve normalcy and not to enhance normal humans into superhumans. It is the responsibility of scientists to bear this burden, as they possess the knowledge and skills to unlock these possibilities. Genetic manipulation should focus on improving the lives of those with genetic disadvantages rather than creating superhumans.", "speed": 0.595872944845063, "eta": "00h00m55s"}

On the beneficial side, genetic engineering is used to improve and sustain the lives of billions of people daily. This is evident through the development of hybrid plants that produce larger harvests, grow in nutrient-deprived regions, or survive with minimal water. Consequently, this ensures more food availability, thereby reducing food prices and allowing people to spend their money elsewhere.\n\nGenetics is also employed in manipulating flowering plants, resulting in flowers with colors that were previously impossible, such as a \"black\" rose. Animals have been manipulated for thousands of years, with selective breeding practices enhancing desirable traits in species like cattle for better milk yields, dogs for fierceness, and cats for taillessness.\n\nManipulation extends to what we consume, including alcohol, which is produced as a waste product by yeast. Yeast has been genetically modified to produce higher concentrations of alcohol, transforming it into a more potent substance.\n\nHowever, the most controversial aspect of genetic manipulation is its application to humans. This raises the question: will eradicating genetic diseases be beneficial, or will it diminish individuality? Many people argue that it is wrong and equate it to playing God. They contend that if natural selection is anything to go by, people are meant to have distinct traits and imperfections.\n\nI believe that if God intended for humans to manipulate genes, He would have endowed us with the intelligence to do so. While I support the eradication of genetic diseases, I oppose the reduction of individuality. Genetic Warfare is another concerning issue, with the creation of so-called \"superhumans\" bred for strength, intuition, and toughness. These practices have been employed for years through the selective training of soldiers and muscle toning routines.\n\nIn conclusion, while genetic manipulation can be a powerful tool for good, it also has the potential to be misused for selfish purposes.

This renaisance period was an opportunity for Da Vinci and others to begin to understand the makings of the World around them, in a more logical and ordered way. In a way Da Vinci is a bad example, as he was not a scientist like you might find today, he was driven by many different things, art, mechanics etc. The difference was that in Da Vinci's day and in Faradays' the was so much unknown that any slight discovery would warrant investigation and the formulation of some rule or other.\n\tModern Scientists have much more information, and a greater technology to work that information into better use. Also there are far more scientists who can do this aswell. Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct an indepth study of a single subject and find out all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday there is less need to take everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, and I consider this a good thing, because how else would technology be updated. However this is not to say that I feel Scientists don't have or shouldn't have a certain curiosity about the unknown, or work is a wider field, but the fact that there are far more men discovering far less to uncover, suggests that some specialisation is the next logical step.\n\tAs far as schools and colleges are concerned I think it is very important to study as wide a field as is possible, because concentrating soley on one science closes so many other doors of discovery. Not to mention the fact that the sciences aid each other in understanding more easily and predicting the outcome.\n\tFor this reason I think combined courses are a very good thing. Not only do they create more of interest in science, in a more rounded sense, but also lay a firmer foundation for specialising at a later date.\n\tA combined course such as Biology and Chemistry opens doors to the likes of Biochemistry, genetic engineering and other professions which rely on a more informed background of science.

The babies produced are often refered to as a 'test tube baby' because they were concieved in a testtube and not in a uterus.\nThere are two ways in which the process can be performed. The first case is if the ovum comes from the 'mother to be', this is usually because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile; if he is infertile a donor's sperm will be used instead. The second case is when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, it is then that a donor's ovum would be used. It is possible that IVF would be used in a case where both these scenarios are combined ie both partners are infertile, although I suspect this may be considered unethical and full of problems.\n\tThis process is full of ethical questions and the rights of all parties, the parents', the donor's and the child's, must be thought out before hand.\nFirstly the rights of the parents; there are two opinions 1) that people should have the right to have children if they want to and if it is possible to give them that chance, they should have it. 2) that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God. Problems may arise if the women was post-menopausal. Should she really be allowed to have children when her body has told ner no?

Firstly, the rights of the parents are a significant concern. One opinion suggests that people should have the right to have children if they want and if it is possible to give them that chance; they should be afforded it. On the other hand, another opinion posits that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God.

This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today. The production line would consist of robots all doing the job of a human but with advantages to the producer.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "As technological advances continue to propel science forward, producing quicker, more powerful products, it becomes imperative for the capacity to manage such projects to develop at an equally rapid pace. This is where computers come into play. Computers can run much faster than the human brain and undoubtedly hold vast amounts of information on a wide array of topics. As the technology progresses, humans increasingly rely on computers due to their remarkable ability to process information and present it in an easily understandable manner. The speed at which computers operate gives them an advantage over human brains.\n\nHowever, there are tasks that computers are not capable of performing. Unlike humans, computers lack free thinking and can only execute what they are programmed to do. This presents a significant challenge; for instance, even the smallest error in the program can lead the computer to follow the incorrect instructions, as it reads and processes the program just like a human would instructions. In such a scenario, a human might have a greater likelihood of detecting the error, resulting in a higher probability of producing a satisfactory product. Although a human would take more time to process the order, the outcome would likely be more accurate. Nevertheless, when the correct program is loaded into the computer, it becomes a more efficient method of production, as demonstrated in the car manufacturing industry today, where production lines consist of robots that outperform humans in speed and consistency, ultimately benefiting the producer.", "speed": 0.595872944845063, "eta": "00h00m55s"}

This shows the need for a human perception of a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one. However, the employment of labour saving devices can be seen as being something that frees the human brain and allows it to contemplate \"higher things\". This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, and indeed it is necessary, to learn more. This is because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is being reduced by the ability to employ machinery.\nThe computer has also served to make the brain redundant, or unused, by the advent of entertainment systems. The almost universal fanaticism of the young, it is also widespread amongst the supposedly more learned adults, for games has led to less employment of the brain. Unless it is to learn to get past level five, a necessary skill for life. This prevents the traditional learning process and wastes time and energy that could be better applied.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "The invention of the computer, while highly useful, still necessitates a human brain to instruct it on what to do.

Despite this, the employment of labor-saving devices can be seen as freeing the human brain, allowing it to contemplate higher things and leading to the advancement of society and individuals. All brains are encouraged to learn more because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is diminishing as machinery becomes more prevalent.\n\nMoreover, the advent of entertainment systems has made the brain redundant in a different way. The widespread enthusiasm for games among both young and supposedly more learned adults has led to a lesser engagement of the brain in traditional learning processes. Games often prevent deeper learning, wasting time and energy that could be better invested in more productive pursuits. This shift highlights another way in which the human brain's role has been altered by the invention of computers, even though the fundamental need for human intellect and creativity remains integral.", "speed": 0.595872944845063, "eta": "00h00m55s"}

Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people from eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.\nPeople eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear for their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone and boil them up to produce offal. Hey presto, instant animal feed. Never mind the fact that cows are herbivores, and knowing better than thousands of years of evolution, this practice has been widespread since the 1980's.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There has always been a wide range of reasons for people not eating beef, or meat in general.

For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.\nIf people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead? The answer is pork, lamb and other meats. The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef. This would mean, that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef.<|end|><|assistant|>", "result": "There are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef.

If people in the U.K. stopped eating beef due to concerns about disease, farmers would face a significant challenge. The market for beef in Europe is limited, and selling it further afield would be too costly. Beef has few major uses other than human consumption, so farmers would struggle to find a viable market if beef was no longer in demand.\n\nAs a result, many farmers might consider switching to other animals, such as sheep. However, the market for sheep is already saturated, leaving few options for farmers to pivot to. Faced with this reality, farmers would turn to other trades. After a long spell of recession, they might eventually recover, but not before suffering significant financial losses.

Also failure for the U.K. to eat beef would mean that no beef would be purchased abroad and so the industry would suffer extreamly. And furthermore the fall that Britain isn't importing beef means that other countrys would'nt want to import UK beef because there is no tradeing between the countrys. This would also mean the change from Beef farming to crops or pig farming which would mean the clustering of all the cows and then wastage of this meat. The industry would also require heavy government subsidys to start the industry running again and for the diversifying by previous beef farmers.

Beef stock would no longer be purchased but instead farmers would try to sell beef stock. However farmers with crops would be trying to increase their field and also increaseing their prices as demand increases.\nThis therefore leads to the conclusion that if people cease to eat meat due to becoming vegetarians or because of the risk of their mental health followed by a slow death economic upset will occur.

The effect on the UK agricultural industry would be devastating, as beef is one of the largest industries in the UK. Additionally, if the UK stops eating beef, no beef would be purchased abroad, leading to extreme suffering for the industry. Furthermore, the cessation of trade between countries would discourage other countries from importing UK beef. This would force a shift from beef farming to crop or pig farming, concentrating cows and leading to meat wastage. The industry would also require heavy government subsidies to start again and diversify. However, the stop in beef consumption would mean an increase in demand for other livestock and crops, causing a need for expanded production and increased purchase of livestock and crop seeds.
