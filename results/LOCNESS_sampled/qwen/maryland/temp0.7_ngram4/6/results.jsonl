When he returns to Argos, he cannot feel a part of the city for the simple reason that he is innocent, and feels innocent, whereas all those citizens born in Argos and living there, have supposedly been born into guilt. The whole point of the play seems to be an attack on the Church and religion (especially Catholic) which holds good considering Sartre's atheism.\nThe whole city of Argos is in perpetual mourning and repentence for a murder which happened unbeknown to many of them: for those who were around, guilt is theirs for not having prevented the atrocity. The Queen's mournful clothing and black funereal make-up emphasize the point: there is no happiness in the city. They are all allowing themselves to be ruled by the past and, in fact, seem to be in a time-warp, not moving forward, not even seeing their futures. All the features Sartre placed in the play show an exaggerated set-up of the real world and its religion. The fact that religion tells us we are guilty because we are human and we live governed by the murder of Christ which happened unbeknown to us, but we must still repent this sin. A significant attribute is the plague of flies around and in Argos, to enhance the picture of being totally enclosed and \"attacked\" by something which Sartre implies is all in the mind. This ability to shock his audience was an attribute he found very powerful and positive, in that he was thus guaranteed their attention and a reaction. Here, he has even placed a god \"on earth\" as it were, as if to prove that they are in fact no greater than us and the fact that they can produce miracles, has no bearing on their power over us and does in no way justify our servitude under them.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Orestes's birthplace was Argos, and upon the death of his father, who was incidentally murdered, he was taken to Athens to be raised by a noble family.

This play appears to target the Church and religion, especially Catholicism, which aligns with Sartre's atheism. The entire city of Argos is in a state of perpetual mourning and repentance for a murder they often do not fully understand, and those present at the time feel guilt for not having prevented it.

Sartre\u2019s play is an exaggerated mirror of the real world and its religious structures. Religion teaches us we are inherently guilty due to the murder of Christ, which occurred unbeknownst to us, and we are expected to repent for this sin. An interesting element is the plague of flies around and within Argos, symbolizing a mental encirclement that Sartre implies. This aspect serves to shock the audience, ensuring their attention and provoking a response. By placing a god \"on earth,\" Sartre demonstrates that deities are no more significant than humans and that their ability to perform miracles does not justify our servitude to them.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is an intrinsic aspect of human nature, often intertwined with duplicity. As individuals seek to make sense of the absurdity of existence\u2014the inherent tension between man's desire to uncover the truth and the world's incomprehensible nature, compounded by the inevitability of mortality\u2014one of the outcomes is the manifestation of a guilty nature. People may refuse to accept the absurdity of life, attempting to rebel against it through duplicitous means.\n\nIn La Chute, guilt is portrayed in various forms, affecting different characters. Clarence, the protagonist, embodies this struggle. His former life as a lawyer in Paris was characterized by a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. Upon hearing the scream on the bridge, which triggers his recollection of past events, Clarence realizes that his previous life was inherently guilty and duplicitous. The mirror now reflects his double nature, symbolizing his lack of recognition of the human condition and his primary motivation for good deeds: personal satisfaction and control over others.\n\nTo address this guilt, Clarence endeavors to embrace his duplicitous nature, leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. However, the guilt persists. Seeking to atone, he travels to Amsterdam, a place deeply associated with guilt due to the Nazi atrocities. Here, he adopts the role of a \"judge-p\u00e9nitent,\" exposing his own duplicity and judgments to others in an attempt to reclaim a sense of superiority and self-esteem. Clarence's desire to judge others rather than face punishment is evident, as he wishes his interlocutor were a policeman to ensure that his confession would be acted upon. This demonstrates his ongoing struggle to reconcile his past actions with his current identity.\n\nTo vividly illustrate the guilt he feels following his 'fall,' Clarence employs a legal concept, referring to his former friends whom he once dominated. This rhetorical move underscores the complexity of his emotional journey and the deep-seated sense of guilt that continues to haunt him.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Man's mortality is now painfully clear to him, as is the futility of his life. And so Caligula has understood the absurdity of our condition; the fact that we can never possess the world and never have full clarity leaves him with a sense of anguish. However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it. Throughout the play, Caligula's reaction to the discovery of the Absurd is to try and carry out the impossible, thereby changing the nature of the universe, and making man mortal and therefore happy. This is symbolised by his quest for the moon, and he tells Helicon right at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory is quite logical, the impossible possession of the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and could therefore change man's condition. However, the reality is that Caligula can never make man mortal, and so unable to avoid death, he becomes death.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith. They seek refuge in religion, and according to Camus take a <quote>. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Le Mythe de Sisyphe is a novel deeply bound by the duplicity of its themes, particularly the central idea that life is both futile and worth living to the full. Camus explores this concept by delving into the absurdity of life and the question of suicide, which are intricately woven through the narrative.\n\nCamus begins by defining the absurd, viewing it not as an endpoint but as the initial lens through which we must understand existence. He criticizes other philosophers for treating the absurd as a conclusion, whereas he proposes that it should be the starting point. This absurdity emerges when an object or experience is stripped of its everyday meaning, such as when an everyday task loses its purpose. Camus argues that people yearn for clarity or 'clairvoyance,' a term he uses to describe a state of lucidity where we are aware of the limits of our knowledge. Drawing on the Cartesian view, he asserts that while \"I think, therefore I am\" is the only thing we can be certain of, the search for fundamental truths often falls short of this certainty. This disparity between our desire for knowledge and what we can truly know leads to the concept of the absurd.\n\nThe process of becoming an 'absurd' man unfolds in several stages. Initially, an object is suspended from its usual meaning, and then, suddenly, during a mundane task, the very meaning of what one is doing is withdrawn. This realization of futility becomes painfully apparent, as one is struck by the passage of time and a self-hatred for not making better use of life. Camus vividly describes this moment of awareness, where the act of living becomes futile when stripped of the meaning we assign to it. This realization of the absurdity of life engenders a profound sense of solitude and isolation, a darkness that feels as though it doesn't illuminate anything.\n\nAfter this profound realization, Camus notes that some individuals attempt to deny the absurdity of life by seeking refuge in faith, taking a leap of faith into religion. They cling to beliefs that offer a purpose beyond the limits of human understanding. However, Camus portrays this as a form of escapism that, while offering temporary solace, does not truly confront the inherent absurdity of existence.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

The account of Clamence's fall is not the retelling of an \"\u00e9venement\" but can be more accurately be described as \"un \u00e9tat de l'\u00e2me\", in which Clamance is embued with guilt and the desire to judge other people. Guilt is implicit in the account, due to the fact that it is focalized through the form of a confension, by Jean-Baptiste Clamance, an ex-parisienne lawyer, however it is also implicit in various subtilties throught the play, and alludes to the universal guilt of mankind. Clamance introduces himself as a \"juge-p\u00e9nitent\", these term is not clarfied until the end of the novel, and it demonstrates Clamance's tendency to judge people, his desire to feel superior to other people and to apportion guilt to those he encounters.\nClamence's former profession as a lawyer seems to back up this theme. It meant that he was in a milieu of guilt, since he was defending people guilty of crimes, or trying to prove people guilty of crimes. His profession gave him a feeling of superiority. In the court he often felt superior to the judge and he enjoyed the satisfaction he got from looking down on people and judging theme. Guilt and judgement are inherent in the legal system.\nIn Paris, Clamence led what he thought was a happy and satisfying lilfe. He enjoyed helping people because of the satisfaction it gave him. He continued this existance until he was shaken into acknowledging what he felt was the true state of the world, by a laugh on a bridge.

His profession instilled in him a sense of superiority, and in court, he often felt superior to the judge, deriving satisfaction from looking down on and judging others. Guilt and judgment are inherent aspects of the legal system.\n\nIn Paris, Clamence believed he was leading a happy and fulfilling life, deriving satisfaction from helping others. However, his existence was shaken when a laugh on a bridge made him realize the true state of the world. This realization broke his complacency and made him acutely aware of his own guilt.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story. This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula. Our own values and emotions play a large role in this right from the start when Caligula  is thought to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla. This grief although incorrectly perceived by his courtiers, perhaps makes us feel sympathy for Caligula. When his patriciens think that the young Emperor is ill or mentally disturbed we may feel sympathy for him if we areselves do not like being unwell.\nCaligula is based on Camus' theme of the absurd, which is according to Ad\u00e8le King \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires\". From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of human existence. He murders indiscriminantly, causes famine and even kills his own lover. What man wants is to be immortal and happy, something which, with the knowledge of the absurd, Caligula knows is impossible. However Caligula revolts against the absurd by trying to achieve the impossible so that <quote>. The symbol of this impossibility is the moon. Caligula thinks that if he can have the moon he will be above the gods and in charge of an empire where the impossible is king. Caligula therefore decides to be destiny - <quote>. He wants to show his people the one truth he has - that <quote>. He sets out to show them their immortality and their sadness by killing them. To a certain extent Camus manages to evoke sympathy and admiration for Caligula in that the Emperor wants to share the truth he has found about the world with his people. He wants to help them understand for their own good. He wants to make them aware of the absurd, as he is, so that they can then go on to live quantatively and intensly.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In Caligula, the narrative is constructed through the interactions among the characters, each of whom is either negatively or positively valued to evoke sympathy for the titular character. Caligula is the central figure, his actions, thoughts, and words driving the entire story forward. This focalization leaves it up to the audience or reader to determine whether they feel sympathy or admiration for him, with their personal values and emotions playing a significant role from the outset. For instance, when Caligula is believed to be in mourning for the death of his sister, Drusilla, the courtiers' incorrect perception may make us feel sympathy for him. Similarly, when his peers think he is ill or mentally disturbed, we might feel empathy if we empathize with his condition.\n\nCaligula's character resonates with Camus' theme of the absurd, as described by Ad\u00e8le King, \"the insoluble opposition between what (man) is and what man desires.\" From the death of Drusilla until his own demise, Caligula becomes acutely aware of the mortality of human beings and the futility of existence, which he attempts to combat through his erratic and often cruel actions. He murders indiscriminately, instigates famine, and even kills his own lover\u2014all in an attempt to achieve immortality and happiness, realizing the impossibility of such desires. Caligula revolts against the absurd by seeking the impossible, symbolized by the moon. He believes that if he can possess the moon, he will transcend mortality and control an empire where the impossible is the norm. Caligula thus declares himself as destiny, wanting to reveal the one truth he has discovered to his people: that they are mortal and sad. His goal is to show them their immortality and sadness through acts of violence, hoping to help them understand and embrace their existence.\n\nIn a certain sense, Camus skillfully evokes both sympathy and admiration for Caligula. The Emperor desires to share his profound understanding of the world\u2019s absurdity with his people to help them live more intensively and authentically. Despite his cruel and chaotic actions, there is a noble intention behind his efforts to enlighten his subjects.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

However the way the violence is carried out, the immediate aims of the violence and the victims of this violence are all different. One common denominator however is that the violence is carried out in the name of the communists.\nThe first difference I wish to make is that regarding the target of political violence. In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on the Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands to the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.\nIn 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off. The political violence here concerns the communist leaders attempt to have Hoederer murdered by planting Hugo into Hoederer's office as his secretary. Hugo has orders to kill Hoederer.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Political violence in Albert Camus's \"Les Justes\" and Boris Pilnyak's \"Les Mains Sales\" is a critical aspect of both works, yet the nature and scope of the violence are distinct. While the violence is executed in the name of the communists in both novels, the targets, immediate aims, and victims of this violence differ significantly.\n\nIn \"Les Justes,\" the political violence is directed outward, targeting the ruling members of 1905 Russia. The terrorist wing of the revolutionary party attempts the assassination of Grand Duke Sergei, ultimately resulting in his death. This violence seeks to topple the existing oppressive regime and return the land to the people, freeing them from tyranny, oppression, and the tangible issue of hunger.\n\nIn contrast, \"Les Mains Sales\" depicts a more internal conflict within the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria, ruled by a Fascist Regent, is the backdrop for this internal strife. The Regent is not the object of the political violence; instead, his attention is drawn to Hoederer, the leader of the socialists. Hoederer aims to achieve a modicum of power through an alliance with the Fascists, with the ultimate goal of seizing complete control. This political violence, however, targets the communist leadership, who attempt to eliminate Hoederer by planting Hugo as his secretary with instructions to murder him.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

They also however interact with each other, making the arguments of the other more credible or maybe discounting other's arguments and thus swaying the audience to one side. It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him - <quote>. Shocked that it is not for his sister that he mourns but the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.\nHe announces that he wants \"la lune\" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but to other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too. We see that he is searching for something out of reach, and we have sympathy knowing that the moon is impossible. Camus explores this theme in Le Mythe de Sisyphe where he says thant man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, onnes with nature, and innocence, but instead recieves lies, disorder, and a separation of man and nature ending in death not immortality - and warns <quote>. The audience knows that the moon is not <quote> and takes pity.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the play \"Caligula,\" Camus explores the themes of death and the absurd, and through the interactions and reactions of the characters, he engenders a complex emotional journey for the audience. At the outset, Drusilla's death evokes a sense of sympathy and mourning, yet as the play progresses, we are disoriented to learn that her 'death' merely revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to Caligula\u2014<quote>. This revelation prompts a shift in our perception, as we are left bewildered by Caligula's focus on the state of the human condition rather than personal loss. Despite the shock, Caligula's words begin to resonate with us, compelling us to see the world through his eyes and find him fascinating.\n\nCaligula's subsequent declaration that he wants \"la lune\" (the moon) initially appears ridiculous to the audience. However, as other characters, such as H\u00e9licon, affirm his quest\u2014saying, <quote>\u2014we begin to accept this as an equally plausible endeavor. We see that Caligula is seeking something beyond the mundane, and our sympathy is piqued, knowing that the moon is unattainable. This quest mirrors Camus's exploration in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe,\" where he posits that humans pursue truth, understanding, clarity, oneness with nature, and innocence, yet are met with lies, disorder, and the separation of man from nature, leading to death rather than immortality\u2014Camus warns, <quote>. The audience, aware of the impossibility of the moon, feels a deep sympathy for Caligula's pursuit, and this shared understanding allows us to find him, and his argument, more credible.\n\nThrough these transitions, Camus masterfully manipulates our emotions and perspectives, ultimately leading us to sympathize with a character whose actions are initially abhorrent. The interplay between Caligula's words and those of other characters serves to highlight the absurdity of their quest and the futility of human desires, yet also the inherent humanity and complexity of Caligula's quest for meaning in a chaotic world.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

His eyes are opened to the absurdity and apparent futility of life by the death of Drusilla for whom he had an incestuous love. He consequently adopts the logic that the only way of defeating this absurdity is to attain the impossible, represented by the his desire to possess the moon. He maintains this logic throughout the play and thus exemplifies the lucidity of one who is aware of the absurd: <quote>.\nHis logic is, however, shown to be morally wrong. He espouses death, orders arbitrary killings and thereby conducts the politics of the land based on the concept of quantitive ethics: one has to die at sometime so why not die sooner than later. In this way, he is shown to have lost all sense of social bonds and scruples.\nDespite these crimes he is, however, seen to have the respect of others around him. Cherea, for example, respects his logic and admits that <quote>. This is what Caligula intends to do in the belief that <quote>. \nThe patricians reinforce the effect that Caligula is to some extent respectworthy:\nThe semiotic square above illustrates how the patricians contrast Caligula.

This event opens his eyes to the absurdity and apparent futility of life, leading him to adopt a radical logic: the only way to overcome this absurdity is by pursuing the impossible, symbolized by his desire to possess the moon. Throughout the play, he steadfastly adheres to this logic, embodying the lucidity of one who is deeply aware of the absurd nature of existence.\n\nWhile his logic is stark and philosophically sound, Caligula is shown to be morally reprehensible. He advocates for death, orders arbitrary killings, and governs based on the concept of quantitative ethics\u2014arguing that since everyone will die eventually, it might as well be sooner rather than later. This approach reveals his complete detachment from social bonds and moral scruples.\n\nDespite his crimes, Caligula commands respect among his peers.

The patricians, too, recognize a certain respectworthiness in Caligula, as exemplified by Scipion, who demonstrates understanding and even assists with Caligula's quest.\n\nHowever, it is ultimately Cherea and Caesonia who challenge the moral validity of Caligula's logic. Cherea respects Caligula\u2019s intellect but rejects his actions, while Caesonia directly confronts Caligula, arguing that <quote>.

If this is the case then all actions are equal, as nothing really matters. <quote>.\nMan is born free, according to Camus and he has the choice to be however he chooses and can change this way of living whenever he wishes. Camus was an athiest so he did not believe in any metaphysical power or fate which dictated how you should act. \nMan is always in search of knowledge & truth.

The only truth that we can be sure of is that we are mortal and will one day die. The awareness of the absurd may lead us to think that suicide would be a natural consequence of seeing the futility of life, but Camus doesn't believe that at all.

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children would then go on to Lyc\u00e9e and either to University or \"Les Grandes Ecoles\" so joining the class of the \u00e9lite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today. \nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a major concern for the later governments. Under the second and third republics not much advance was made on the education question as this did not appear to be a priority.\nUnder the forth republic reforms were proposed but because of the multi-party governments who had to face internal struggles all the time, they failed in most cases to be passed.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Before delving into the current and recent situation of French education, it is essential to examine its historical roots, particularly focusing on the late 18th century when Napoleon Bonaparte articulated his views on education. Napoleon believed that education was crucial for the smooth functioning of the state, but it was not necessarily a right for all citizens. Given that the majority of the population was engaged in agriculture at the time, education was restricted to basic primary schooling, which the church largely provided. He recognized the importance of secondary and higher education, as they were vital for training professionals needed by the state. Consequently, the state took charge of these levels of education.\n\nThis system, established by Napoleon, inadvertently created a significant gap between primary and secondary education. This disparity persisted until relatively recent times, despite numerous attempts at reform. The educational structure did not facilitate substantial social mobility. Children from poorer backgrounds typically left primary school with minimal education, while those from wealthier families could continue to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children often progressed through lyc\u00e9es, universities, or \"Grandes \u00c9coles,\" ultimately joining the elite class. This form of elitism has endured to some extent into the present day.\n\nThe gap between primary and secondary education eventually became a focal point of concern for subsequent governments. During the Second and Third Republics, education was not considered a priority, and little advancement was made. Under the Fourth Republic, proposals for reform were introduced, but the ongoing struggles within multi-party governments often impeded their implementation.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

On studying France throughout the twentieth century we can see that this is indeed true.\nIf we start at the beginning of the century we see that the growth of the population was inhibited greatly by the first world war, where France suffered many losses. The fact that the men in the society left to fight meant that the number of births was reduced greatly. This was also the case on the return of the men, when many did not come back having been killed. Therefore after the first world war the population of France decreased greatly.\nImmigration was already present at this time, and helped to make up for the large number of losses in the war. Slowly the population began to build itself up again until the beginning of the Second World War. In this war France did not suffer as many casualties and deaths as in the first world war, but the fact that there had already been losses made the situation grave for France. The economy needed rebuilding, as did the whole country, and the work force was very depleated. There was an urgent call for immigrant workers to come to France, and indeed they did come (about 4 million).\nWhen the troops came home, and families were reunited there was a great increase in births. The previous Malthusian attitude that less children meant a better life and greater security was replaced by a new attitude that in order to create and rebuild France a strong workforce was needed. Having a child was regarded as an 'investment in the future'. The french realised that a defeat was due to the fact that they were not a strong nation, and they wanted to build such a nation.\nThe gouvernement also adopted various policies to try and increase births in the society. It was suggested in the 1920s that contraception should be made illegal, but in the end this was restricted. Family allowances were increased, and medical costs were paid for in order to try and encourage births. Also leave from work was increased.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Studies in demography have shown that the growth of a nation is closely linked to its economic development, social structure, and cultural trends. This relationship is evident when examining France throughout the twentieth century. At the dawn of the century, the nation's population growth was significantly hindered by the First World War, which resulted in immense losses. The departure of men to fight reduced the number of births, and the high death toll among returning soldiers further decreased the population.\n\nImmigration played a crucial role in compensating for these losses. Although present before the war, immigration helped to gradually rebuild the population until the outbreak of the Second World War. Unlike the First World War, France did not suffer as many casualties in the Second World War, but the depleted workforce and economy required urgent attention. The government called for immigrant workers, and approximately four million people responded to this call.\n\nUpon the end of the war, families were reunited, and there was a significant increase in births. The previous Malthusian perspective, which emphasized fewer children for a better life, gave way to a new attitude. In order to rebuild and strengthen France, a robust workforce was seen as essential. Having a child was viewed as an \"investment in the future,\" and the French recognized that a defeated nation lacked the necessary strength.\n\nIn response to this need, the government implemented various policies to encourage higher birth rates. Suggestions included making contraception illegal, though this was ultimately restricted. Family allowances were increased, and medical costs were covered to encourage more births. Additionally, work leave was extended. These measures collectively aimed to nurture a stronger, more prosperous nation.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Although any French citizen with the baccaleaur\u00e9at is entitled through the constitution to a university education, the system is still characterised by major inequalities.\nThe system of non-selection for all univerisity courses (with a few exceptions such as dentistry and medecine had led to the impoverishment of the quality of instruction and the status of the universities.

After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff. However, universities were often divided into new universities according to the political leanings of its professors, and have been held back by political squabbles.

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism. The CFDT (Conf\u00e9deration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail), has a more reformist stance, and the FO (Force Ouvri\u00e8re) has a more co-operation nature.\nPerhaps due to the ideological extremism of the CGT, perhaps through fear of losing jobs, or of opposing a very authoritative patronat, union membership in France has always been weak, representing at the present time only 15% of the workforce.

In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to reflect the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.\nWhen the socialists came to power in 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the \"code du travail\" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1/3 of this \"Code du Travail\" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, and before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.\nTrade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had to wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given a legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes. \nThe main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership of the PCF is  a large aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conf\u00e9deration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail-force ouvri\u00e8re) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become too radical for many of its Catholic members. The CFDT is connected with the PS (Partie Socialiste) although it is the least eager to appear as acting as a back-up for politics.\nBesides these 3 groups there are many other Trade Union formations in France - their large number meaning weakness and low membership.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "All industrial relations in France are rooted in socialist groupings, a structure that has proven to be weak and largely unsuccessful. This deficiency reflects the instability and division within socialist political parties, whose underlying prejudices and differences render them ineffective. When the socialists assumed power in 1981, trade unions harbored high hopes for reforms. The subsequent Auroux laws of 1982 and 1983 aimed to address the \"Code du Travail,\" which had been inadequately implemented, particularly due to the prevalence of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise. The socialists managed to overhaul about one-third of this \"Code du Travail,\" enhancing worker protections, establishing stricter rules on disciplinary matters, and increasing the freedom of expression. However, this progress was short-lived, as the socialists, contrary to trade union expectations, facilitated easier redundancies and introduced more flexible working hours before the 1986 elections.\n\nTrade Unions in France were legalized in 1884, though their activities were severely restricted. They were not allowed to convene meetings or occupy factory floors, and public services, including railways, were initially prohibited from unionizing. It wasn't until November 1968 that trade unions gained legal recognition in factories and workplaces. This came as a result of the extensive and violent strikes during the May 1968 events, when approximately 100,000 workers went on strike, compelling employers to reconsider their stance.\n\nThe primary trade union group is the CGT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail), established in 1895 and closely aligned with the Communist Party (PCF). The PCF's influence significantly aids CGT membership. Another major union, CGT-FO (conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail-force ouvri\u00e8re), broke away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9mocratique du travail), the third largest union, emerged in 1963 following a split within the CFTC, which had become too radical for its Catholic members.

This, he confirmed, would be typical of any constitution in a traditionally democratic Western society. Despite this limitation de Gaulle and his followers were able to shape the new Constitution largely according to their own views as to what would constitute a strong and durable republican regime. Debr\u00e9, for example, was impressed by the British model; parlementarisme rationnel meant that the Government is not at the mercy of Parliament, yet is ultimately answerable to it and thereby be forced to resign.\nDe Gaulle, however, was the main inspiration of the Constitution. His experience of 1940 made him realise the need for strong, determined leadership from the top. Before the war this was greatly lacking.\nThe majority of articles relevant to the Presidnet in the 1958 Constitution were largely similar to those under the Third and Fourth Republics. Despite this, there were several new powers introduced and listed in Article 19 including, for example, Article 11 - referendum, Article 12 - right of dissolution and Article 16 - emergency powers.\nThere were, however ambiguities and certainties in the text which have proved very significant in determining the President's role in the 5th Republic. The role of the Prime Minister was such that he had powers and responsibilities in respect of government policy that could be seen to overlap with the President's function to mediate (arbitrage) between contending groups to ensure the smooth running of the country, assigned to him by Article 5.\nThis was open to varying interpretation. The maximalist interpretation was generally accepted. This meant that the President, instead of being limited to the 'domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9' ie the powers attributed to him under the Constitution, he was justified by virtue of this article in intervening in policy-making and its implementation.\nThe President was also independent in carrying out this function: he was not accountable to Parliament by virtue of ARticle 68 and not even directly accountable to it via ministers or the Prime Minister for their 'contreseing'(countersignature) was not required by him.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The Algeiran crisis led to a significant shift in French political landscape in 1958, prompting the French Parliament to allow de Gaulle and his government to recast the political groundrules through a new constitution.

The number of French employees unionized is relatively small (about 11%) and thus there is great competition between individual trade unions for membership, and a great distinction between the individual characteristics.\nDuring an economic expansion, as was experienced by France in the period 1945-75, unions can make demands for their workers for better pay and working conditions. But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.\nMembership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions has always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, those members who were left tended to be those who identified with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.\nBefore 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's demands, and this did not help the falling membership numbers.\nEmployers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation. This was because the great majority of firms in France were small family concerns which had sprung up in the 19th century - the PME (petites et moyennes entreprises). The boss was seen as a patriarch who should not be challenged.\nThe period of industrial relations in France under the 5th Republic can be divided into three periods. The first is 1958 to 1968. During this time the State was highly interventionist in its approach to the economy, regulating pay and price levels and investing in and developping the economy. Employers were wary of unions, so the state had to act as an intermediary between the two sides to develop a little dialogue between them. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The trade union movement in France originated after the French Revolution and has consistently had a revolutionary or ideological character.

Additionally, there is a notable distinction in the characteristics of these unions.\n\nDuring economic expansions, such as the period from 1945 to 1975, trade unions were able to advocate effectively for better wages and working conditions. However, during recessions, particularly those following economic crises like the one triggered by the 1975 oil crisis, their demands became ineffective, leading to a decline in membership. This pattern was evident in France.\n\nMembership declined as unions were perceived as ineffective in securing worker demands. Given the political nature of these unions, their limited appeal further constrained their ability to attract and retain members. Consequently, the remaining members tended to align closely with the unions' political views, limiting the scope of union aims.\n\nPrior to 1968, unions were not legally permitted in the workplace, and negotiation efforts were minimal. What existed was largely at a general and regional level, which was distant from the specific demands of the average worker and contributed to the declining membership numbers.\n\nEmployers often harbored suspicion towards unions, viewing them as a threat rather than a valuable representation mechanism.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament. De Gaulle ended by strengthening the Executive in favour of the presidency and his interpretation of the most ambiguous word in the text, \"arbitrage\" has been untouched for more than 30 years.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Under the Fifth Republic, the most salient feature to emerge is the form of presidentialism initiated by General de Gaulle and maintained by his successors.

The Fourth Republic, characterized by a weak government and presidency, saw power concentrated in the divided National Assembly. The collapse of the Fourth Republic and the escalating Algerian crisis propelled the charismatic figure of de Gaulle back into power, seen as the only person capable of addressing the Algerian issue. De Gaulle, having witnessed France's humiliation during World War II and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the Vichy regime, and later aligned with the United States, recognized this sickness as a result of the weakened state and its authority. Upon returning to power in 1958, de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a robust Executive, a role he aspired to lead. His impact on the 1958 constitution cannot be overstated; while it was crafted to suit his vision, the constitution evolved into an even more tailored framework for him due to subsequent amendments and changes in political life.\n\nOn drafting the constitution, two conflicting notions were reconciled. De Gaulle favored a return to the Bonapartist tradition of the President having nearly omnipotent powers, whereas others, wary of such concentrated power, advocated for a stronger government.

De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent centrings made it clear that a clearly visible president was required, who would be the 'keystone' to the parliamentary r\u00e9gime. The constitution of 1958 honoured this, by placing the President first among the members of parliament.\nThere is however a fundamental difference between the powers that the constitution and those who drafted it gave the President and the powers that he subsequently acquired. The result is a very interesting example of how circumstances and personality can change the constitution.\nThe constitution had originally left policy and decision making to the prime minister and his government (articles 20-23). The power granted under article twelve to dissolve parliament would, according to Michel Debr\u00e9, only allow a short exchange with the public. According to the constitution, the President was only to assume the role of constitutional dictator in times of grave trouble (art. 16). In a brilliant exegis of the constitution he had authored in large part, Michel Debr\u00e9 said that the role of the President was to be that of an arbiter, to oversee the constitution, and be 'beyond politics and the political parties. \nThis seems to have been somewhat unrealistic. Neither the war in Algeria, nor, despite appearances the personality of de Gaulle would let him be the arbiter of the constitution. \nThe referendum in 1962 gave the President the legitimacy of the public vote. Now he was directly answerable to the people.\nIn 1964 Charles de Gaulle realistically defined his role as President. He was still prepared to play the role of arbiter when absolutely necessary.

De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent actions made it clear that a visibly prominent president was required, who would serve as the \"keystone\" to the parliamentary regime. The 1958 constitution honored this expectation by positioning the President as the first among the members of parliament.\n\nHowever, there is a fundamental difference between the powers the constitution and those who drafted it intended to grant the President, and the powers he subsequently acquired. This discrepancy provides an interesting example of how circumstances and personality can reshape the constitution. According to the original constitution, policy and decision-making were primarily the responsibility of the prime minister and his government (articles 20-23). Article 12 allowed for the dissolution of parliament but only permitted a brief public consultation. Article 16 confined the President's role to that of a constitutional dictator during times of grave trouble. Michel Debr\u00e9, a key drafter of the constitution, described the President as an arbiter, someone who would oversee the constitution and stand \"beyond politics and the political parties.\"\n\nWhile this seemed somewhat unrealistic, the war in Algeria and de Gaulle's personality did not allow him to remain in this role. The 1962 referendum, which gave the President the legitimacy of the public vote, marked a significant shift. Now, he was directly answerable to the people.\n\nIn 1964, Charles de Gaulle realistically defined his role as President. While he was still willing to play the role of arbiter when absolutely necessary, he saw himself as the head of parliament and viewed no other institution, whether social or judicial, as higher than himself. He perceived parliament as \"sitting around him.\"", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was practiced and preached by his predecessors. So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.\nThe role of the president is defined in the Constitution but is rather ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an \"arbiter\". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the making of policies or does it mean he must intervene and play an active role?\nThe term 'arbiter' is sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this they did. De Gaulle claimed it empowered him to rule the nations and his successors all acted as if it meant playing an interventionist role.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The constitution of the Fifth Republic, adopted on September 28, 1958, served as a compromise between the Gaullists and other political forces. Despite its controversial nature, two key facts emerged: the presidency was significantly strengthened, and the executive branch gained more power relative to the parliament. I will first discuss the roles of the prime minister and the president, and then analyze how each president's tenure has shaped the evolution of these roles.\n\nIn the constitution, the exact locus of authority is not clearly defined, a fact that has led to considerable ambiguity and debate. Some articles suggest that the prime minister is in charge, while others indicate that the president holds the primary power. Furthermore, past presidents and prime ministers have often claimed their respective prerogatives. For instance, there was a suggestion for a \"twin-headed\" executive, but prime ministers have consistently accepted the president's supremacy.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the prime minister is generally responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the government, with specific powers, such as the appointment of ministers. However, in practice, these powers have often been usurped by the president. Giscard d'Estaing, when asked about the prime minister's role, described it as being in charge of contingency issues, whereas the president handled permanent and essential matters. This response, while violating the spirit of the constitution, echoed the practices of his predecessors, suggesting that the role of the prime minister remains a contentious issue.\n\nThe president's role is more clearly defined in the constitution but is equally ambiguous and subject to interpretation. Article 5 describes the president as an \"arbiter,\" a term that is vague enough to allow for a variety of interpretations. This ambiguity has led to differing practices: Charles de Gaulle claimed that the term empowered him to rule, and his successors have acted as if the role required active intervention in policy-making.\n\nIn summary, the constitution of the Fifth Republic has established a presidency and an executive that are both strengthened compared to their predecessors. However, the specific roles and responsibilities of the prime minister and the president remain contentious, with each president interpreting and adapting these roles according to their vision for governance.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the debacle of the Fourth Republic, marked by government and ministerial instability that led to limited, compromise-driven coalition governments, France desperately needed a strong governmental base. The crisis reached its peak in 1958 during the Algerian uprising and unrest. De Gaulle, who had first outlined his vision for a new constitution in 1946 at Bayeux, had been sidelined by the French and the victorious allies who did not appreciate his authoritarian leadership style. By 1958, the country was in dire need of his leadership, and the referendum on the new Fifth Republic constitution received an overwhelming 85% 'yes' vote\u2014sharply contrasting with the apathetic 53% vote from a 35% turnout that had marked the beginning of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution aimed to clearly separate the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, with executive power stemming directly from the president. De Gaulle's actions soon made it clear who held the reins of power.\n\nSeveral ambiguities surround the definition of the President's functions. Article 16 grants the President special powers during national emergencies, but there are no clear criteria for determining what constitutes such emergencies. In 1961, De Gaulle invoked these powers in Algeria, an action that was heavily debated and widely perceived as an abuse of authority. The nature of the emergency was disputed, with many believing that De Gaulle was overstepping his bounds.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat', a similar r\u00f4le to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It gave the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debr\u00e9, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reserv\u00e9\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian r\u00f4le of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.\nArticle 11 was not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle used it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to use Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition. It was also a good way to increase contact with the people outside of the normal methods.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Much of this ambiguity arose from the fact that the Constitution was a compromise between \"presidentialisme\" and \"parlementarism.\" The President was endowed with traditional powers of the Head of State and was also designated as the \"chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat,\" a role comparable to that of the Queen, as well as becoming the Chief of the Army. Through Articles 8, 12, and 11 of the Constitution, the President was granted substantial power, as he did not require the \"contreseing\" (counter-signature) of the Prime Minister or other ministers. It was particularly Article 8 that introduced the main ambiguity, granting the President the power to appoint the Prime Minister but remaining vague on whether he could dismiss him. De Gaulle capitalized on this ambiguity, initially appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958 but forcing him to resign in 1962, as De Gaulle perceived Debr\u00e9 to be useful during wartime but deemed him unnecessary after the Algerian conflict. This decision demonstrated that the choice of Prime Minister was ultimately his prerogative, setting a precedent for the President's exclusive domain in governance. By initially appointing Debr\u00e9, De Gaulle established a precedent that the President would handle long-term issues, particularly foreign and defense policies, while the Prime Minister would address short-term domestic concerns. This autocratic and authoritarian role of the President evolved throughout the Fifth Republic.\n\nArticle 11, in contrast, was less ambiguous, allowing the President to put important decisions to a referendum. De Gaulle utilized Article 11 in 1961 to inquire whether the French supported allowing the Algerians to determine their own future. Pompidou employed the same article in 1973 to gauge public opinion on the potential enlargement of the European Community, especially in light of the British desire to join under Heath's leadership. However, Pompidou used this tool strategically to divide his opposition and to enhance direct contact with the people beyond conventional methods.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century have been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, and the consequent ageing of the population.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have been in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, because it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't afford large families.\nThe consequence of these factors was that by the end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, as people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.\nAt the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number of old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and old people. This, and the need to build the economy, led to the influx of immigrant workers into France, with has in turn led to many of today's problems with immigrants.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Demography is the study of population and the effect that its general character has on a country's society and economy. It is a critical factor in understanding a nation's evolution, and many of France's challenges during the twentieth century can be traced back to changes in its demographic profile. For instance, a premature decline in the birth rate during the nineteenth century led to an aging population, which exacerbated various issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was a significant world power. However, since then, both its power and population in comparison to the rest of Europe have been in steady decline. By the start of World War I, France's population was significantly lower than that of Germany, contributing to Germany's confidence in the war. Both world conflicts not only resulted in the loss of thousands of men but also led to a dramatic drop in the birth rate. During the economic depression between the wars, the birth rate remained low due to the gloomy outlook and financial constraints, making large families less feasible.\n\nThese factors culminated in a reduced adult population by the end of World War II. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, leading to the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964, the birth rate rose by 20%, driven by decreases in infant mortality, the introduction of social security and family benefits, new optimism about the future, and the abandonment of traditional Malthusian attitudes in favor of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had started to increase even before the end of the war, as people embraced a care-free attitude with less sense of responsibility.\n\nSimultaneously, the death rate was declining due to medical advances and improved living conditions, leading to a steady increase in the number of elderly individuals. Consequently, post-war France faced a scenario where there was a reduced number of adults to support both a rising number of children and an increasing number of elderly. This situation, alongside the need to rebuild the economy, contributed to the influx of immigrant workers into France, which has subsequently led to contemporary issues related to immigration.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

It was so before mai '68, and despite attempts at reform, it has been determined to remain so. Before 1968, French universities were overcrowded (the number of students rose from 122,000 in 1936 to 612,000 in 1968), centralized and impersonal.\nIn response to the events of '68, the Faure reforms were drawn up. They abolished old universities as such, and gave them the opportunity to form themselves into 'unit\u00e9s d'enseignements et de recherche'. They formed their own councils, and could group themselves into new universities. These universities had their own councils made up of staff, teaching and non-teaching, and student delegates. They elected the President who fulfilled a similar role to that of the British universities' Vice-Chancellor. The Faure reforms gave the universities a framework within which to create a new system of university education and to create new personalities for themselves. These reforms dealt with the centralized and impersonal aspects. But the universities could not cope with their new powers. \nThey reverted back to their interdepartmental wrangling, and when it came to joining together to form universities, the subjects dominated by the Left, suchas sociology, did not want to combine with those subjects dominated by more Right-wing professors. The apolitical sciences did not want to be 'contaminated' by the Left-wingers.\nWithin the new universities, the departments were out to protect their own positions and to protect their share of the global budget, so there was little tendency to create new inter-disciplinary courses as Faure had hoped.\nThe universities are very much out of touch with the needs of the outside world. Their DEUGs and licences were very much theoretical and literal and of no use in finding jobs in specialized industry. Many professors wanted to keep universities as 'la finalit\u00e9 culturelle'. Donot want interaction with patrons, etc. But this is necessary to make degrees more relevant to job requirements.\nAlso left wing departments resisted any attempt by State for reform. Refused to see such attempts as sincere or benevolent, always suspected state of ulterior motives. \nGulf between universities and Grandes Ecoles slightly bridged by Instituts Universitaires de Technologie, but governments leave Grandes Ecoles to themselves as serve France well and were not infected by virus of '68.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The French system of higher education has always been hierarchical and divided, a structure that persisted both before and after the events of 1968.

At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixi\u00e8me year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization. He tried to prolong school life for a large number of pupils by making education compulsory until the age of 16, abolishing the entrance examination to the 'sixi\u00e8me' and abandoning the 'classe de la fin des \u00e9tudes', where children stayed at primary school until 14. He introduced the concept of orientation and observation, whereby a pupil could be directed towards the school mostly suited to his needs (the prestigious lyc\u00e9e and the College d'Enseignement G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), whilst trying to bring the two schools closer together. The lyc\u00e9e had always been the bastion of \u00e9litism, with its Napoleonic tradition.\nIn 1963 Fouchet created the College d'Enseignement Secondaire, a lower common secondary school, to try and encourage upward social mobility. Jean Capelle, a leading figure in the initiative had very much admired, and tried to emulate the English comprehensive schools. But in an article by Hain Gaziel, his efforts were a failure. The creation of 3 'fili\u00e8res' were basically a division between prospective lyc\u00e9e and C.E.G. students. The third stream was theoretically intended to push pupils to the upper two streams, but in practice transfer was difficult - only 1% managed it. It was dubbed the 'poubelle' of the system. These two reforms came at the time of a population expansion which demanded education of any kind and prevented proper reforms - giving away a little in order to conserve a great deal.\nSchool pupils became disillusioned, seeing the school as an agent of social discrimination. The lyc\u00e9es were for the bourgeois, cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, while the chances of the children of an 'ouvrier' getting anywhere near higher education were remote.

The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions\u2014lyc\u00e9es, CEGs, and primary schools\u2014and little transfer of pupils actually occurred, with only about 1% transferring to the lyc\u00e9e on average. Although syllabuses were harmonized in these institutions, this was found to be inefficient and insufficient in terms of promoting equality of opportunity.\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers, and trade unions, the Fouchet reforms of 1963 proposed a common middle school for all pupils, the CES (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement secondaire). Fouchet's plan involved converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9es into separate units and transforming the CEGs to form the new middle school. Pupils would enter the lyc\u00e9e based on their carte scolaire rather than an examination. While lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards and middle-class parents worried about tougher competition for their children, the conversion of these schools was met with resistance. According to the Legrand report, the CES never fully materialized. However, the CES did provide increased equality for pupils, but it also had significant drawbacks, including a streaming system with three fili\u00e8res. The fili\u00e8re number one, dominated by children of the middle class and staffed by what were perceived as bad teachers, further perpetuated social selection for the lyc\u00e9es and hindered the democratization of the education system.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

Provide only the final essay.\n\nHow does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide'?\n\tPhilosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good. Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair. The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in *Candide*?\n\nPhilosophical optimism, the philosophy that everything and every occurrence is for the best, is the foundation that Voltaire critiques in *Candide*. This philosophy is embodied by Pangloss, the philosopher employed at the castle of Thunder-der-Troncks. The entire book serves as a relentless criticism of this worldview. For instance, when Candide is forced to join the Bulgarian army and is nearly beaten to death, he remains undisturbed, believing it to be for his own good. Indeed, his training later allows him to become a skilled soldier, but this could hardly be seen as a positive outcome. Candide's training enables him to kill two men without hesitation: a Jew and an Archbishop, and he then proceeds to kill his own sweetheart's brother. \n\nVoltaire further illustrates his disdain for optimism in a pivotal scene where Pangloss, Candide, and James are caught in a storm at sea. In this storm, James drowns, and only three survive: Candide, Pangloss, and a sailor. Upon their arrival, they find the city destroyed by an earthquake, with widespread starvation and death. Candide is deeply horrified, especially when the sailor begins to pillage the city. Pangloss, in his characteristic optimism, insists that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,\" even as Candide looks to him for reassurance.\n\nDespite his adherence to the ideals of optimism, Candide maintains a skeptical attitude towards it. This is especially evident when he arrives in the New World, where he is forced to leave his beloved Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot fathom what possible good could come from this, particularly since his journey to America was triggered by his killing of the Jew and the Archbishop, who were Cun\u00e9gonde's former lovers. Through these events, the book gradually reveals how optimism is not a philosophy that leads to happiness but rather to a continuous cycle of despair and misfortune.", "speed": 0.4531697717734314, "eta": "00h14m09s"}

The idea of divine providence in a world of human cruelty and natural disasters was ridiculous to him, and he tries to hammer the realities home to his reader.\n\tThe natural environment which should be the easiest for God to control, is mercilessly hard on people. To this end, Voltaire has the protagonist Candide travelling all over the world and witnessing them. The best example is the Lisbon earthquake which claimed thousands of lives so needlessly. The sea is also hostile, claiming the 'life' of Martin during their journey to Portugal. While trekking across the desert from El Dorado the better part of his herd of sheep die of dehydration or quicksand.\n\tCivilization too, is oppressive and destructive. Pangloss was chained to a Turkish galley for the most trivial of reasons, women such as Cungegonde are treated as merchandise, and wars result in mass, pointless genocide (as for example seen in the overly pruriant description of the Bulgarian army atrocities in Westphalia).\n\tIndividual human nature is a variety of negative traits. Cunegonde's Brother is arrogant and patronizing, the sailor on board Candides ship is ungrateful and grossly insensitive to human suffering, the police are corruptible and have double standards and many more. In fact each individual usually has at least one unpleasant side to his/her personality.\n\tThe purpose of nature, civilization and personality being portrayed in such an overly bad light is to show how there is hardly anything 'qui va pour le mieux dans le monde' let alone thinking that everything does.\n\tThere is hardly any evidence of good will or the benign influence of God throughout the entire book (excepting Martin and the seemingly miraculous escapes which certain characters make from the clutches of death). All the elements contrive in a perverse and malignant way to inflict as much suffering and unhappiness as possible. Certain individuals have been so 'unlucky' that it becomes comic. Pangloss is hanged, dissected alive, flogged and chained to a Turkish galley. There is even one-upmanship in hard luck stories with every person having a claim to being the 'least fortunate person in the world'. All this is to show in as blindingly obvious way as possible that the very notion of optimism is totally absurde.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Philosophical optimism, as espoused by Voltaire, is the target of his critical lens on the social attitudes of the time. The notion of divine providence in a world marred by human cruelty and natural disasters seemed absurd to him. Voltaire sought to drive home the grim realities to his readers, emphasizing that the natural environment, which should be under God's control, is often merciless. This is exemplified through the protagonist Candide's global travels, where he witnesses firsthand the harshness of the natural world, such as the Lisbon earthquake that claimed thousands of lives needlessly. The sea also proves treacherous, as evidenced by the 'life' of Martin being claimed during their journey to Portugal. During their trek across the desert from El Dorado, the majority of the sheep perish from dehydration or quicksand, highlighting the relentless cruelty of the natural environment.\n\nCivilization, in Voltaire's eyes, is equally oppressive and destructive. Pangloss, for instance, is unjustly chained to a Turkish galley for trivial reasons. Women like Cunegonde are treated as mere commodities, and wars result in mass, pointless genocides, such as the Bulgarian army's atrocities in Westphalia. Each individual, from the vainglorious brother to the ungrateful sailor and corrupt police, possesses at least one unpleasant trait, illustrating the negative aspects inherent in human nature.\n\nThe portrayal of nature, civilization, and human nature in such a bleak light underscores Voltaire's point that there is little, if any, evidence of progress or the benign influence of a benevolent God throughout the narrative. There is scant evidence of good will or salutary divine intervention, with characters often experiencing suffering and unhappiness to an indescribable extent. Even those who escape death do so miraculously, but the overarching theme remains that the concept of optimism is absurd. The characters' misfortunes are not just tragic but at times even comic, as seen with Pangloss's series of horrific fates, from hanging to being dissected alive, flogged, and chained to a galley. The competition of misfortune among characters reaches a satirical peak, with each claiming to be the least fortunate person in the world. This relentless portrayal serves to demonstrate that the very notion of optimism is, in Voltaire's view, utterly absurd.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

Thus, he begins the story by making Candide agree to philosophical optimism and listen to his tutor, Dr. Pangloss who preaches it. Then as the story progresses, the changes in attitudes and thoughts can develop, resulting in the way Voltaire believes.\n\tVoltaire aims to persuade the reader that the doctrine of optimism is not a valid one.

In this conte Voltaire savagely condemns the doctrine of optimism; the notion that all is well in the world and that events occur as part of some Divine Purpose. Voltaire rejects this theory of optimism on the basis that there is so much evil in the world and this optimism is subject to great satire throughout 'Candide'. Voltaire presents optimism through the use of Pangloss who religiously adheres to this 'detestable principle' and he contrasts it with the pessimistic views of Martin and by showing many atrocities and evils in the world of which the conte provides an abundance. \n\tIn 1775 an earthquake struck Lisbon killing 40.000 people or more and this severely shook Voltaire's view and faith in God. Voltaire thus began to question the theory of optimism presented by Alexander Pope 1733-4 in his 'Essay on Man' that 'whatever is, is right': Voltaire asked: why do men suffer under a master who is just? Finding no answer, Voltaire rejected the principle of optimism- that logic and reason could somehow explain away the chaotic wretchedness of existence by ignoring the facts. Indeed the question of philosophical optimism is subject to much attack and satire in 'Candide'.\n\tVoltaire tackles it by juxtaposes this doctrine of optimism with the evils in society; rape, pillage, murder, massacre, hanging, storm, disease, earthquake, theft, prostitution contrast the theory that 'tout est bien dans le monde' which heightens its travesty.\n\tIn 'Candide' the character of Pangloss has the aim of representing this ridiculous 'philosophical optimism'. Pangloss believes that there can be 'no effect without cause' and he comes under great satire by Voltaire for adhering to this 'thoughtless optimism'. Pangloss taught 'metaphyisco-, theologo-, cosendo-, nigology'; 'nigology' is a made up word which shows that his teachings are a fraud and therefore Voltaire disreputes optimism. At the beginning of the conte Candide na\u00efvely and innocently believes Pangloss as he is not 'really listening' but is more interested in the beautiful Cun\u00e9gonde.

The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to the earthquake itself.\n\tIn 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it. We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. Pangloss then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\tThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. This 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is clear to all but Pangloss showing no sympathy consoles Candide by saying that it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.\n\tVoltaire is in full flow now with incident after incident which stretch the reader's credulity to the limit but also go to show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point which is outlined above when the real earthquake occured.\n\tThe plot then goes into a ridiculous level. Candide is whipped and Pangloss is hanged at a magnificant auto-da-f\u00e9 which was held so that similar earthquakes would not strike Lisbon again.

It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he was alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it was only when man discovered the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus found the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.\n\tRousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads to the development of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.\n\tThis is the development of man into society from a stage of equality into a life of human inequality.\n\tRousseau looks at 'man-made-man' and sees how he is dehumanised when compared with earlier man.\n\tThe social development which occurred when men desired self-improvement led to man being capable of advancement due to science and scientific knowledge but as  Rousseau said, 'these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the *Discours sur l'origine de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9*, Rousseau vividly portrays how the advancement of civilization has corrupted man's natural state of happiness and freedom by creating artificial inequalities of power, wealth, and social privilege. To understand this corruption, Rousseau traces human development from its nascent stages to the societal structures of the eighteenth century, identifying the primary sources of human equality.\n\nRousseau envisions the natural man as physically robust and content in his woodland habitat, uncomplicated, and with minimal needs such as food, a mate, and rest. For Rousseau's argument, it is crucial to see this natural man as innocent, independent, and inherently good. When man lived alone and relied on no one, he was equal to his fellow man. However, it was the discovery of cooperation and civilization that initiated man's decline, leading to social inequalities. \n\nRousseau outlines man's development through five distinct stages. The initial stage represents man's innocence, where he is entirely self-reliant and free from corruption. In the second stage, man forms a 'family' unit, building a shelter and taking on roles as protector and father. This period is Rousseau\u2019s \"golden age,\" but it is also marked by the seeds of corruption as desire for self-improvement emerges. The third stage involves the advent of property and the concept of ownership, which leads to conflict and a \"war of all against all,\" as Hobbes described. The final stage sees the establishment of a social contract to ensure peace and escape the constant state of war.\n\nThis journey from equality to inequality highlights how human development into society transforms man into a being capable of significant advancement through science and knowledge. Yet, as Rousseau lamented, these supposed improvements are sources of man\u2019s misfortunes. Thus, Rousseau\u2019s exploration of man's transformation from a state of innocence to one of societal inequality underscores the complex interplay between progress and human nature.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurances, whether good or bad, is that 'all is for the best in the best of all worlds' it does not matter how much human misery and violence he is exposed to he still quotes his philosophy. \n\tVoltaire demonstrates the futility of this attitude in a very amusing, fast flowing way, Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\tVoltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences are good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westiphalia have been destroyed and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette, yet Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, there is no despair. Pangloss merely states that if it were not for syphilis there would be no chocolate in the world. Again through the complete absurdity of this comment Voltaire tackles the problem of thoughtless optimism.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Thoughtless optimism is a central theme in Voltaire's \"Candide,\" personified through the character of Pangloss, a ridiculous philosopher who believes that \"all is for the best in the best of all worlds.\" Regardless of the vast amount of human misery and violence he encounters, Pangloss consistently upholds his philosophy, demonstrating the futility of this attitude in a fast-paced and humorous manner. Voltaire employs Pangloss as a literary device to convey his criticism of thoughtless optimism, not by dismantling it incrementally but by elevating it to such absurd extremes that it becomes laughably untenable.\n\nVoltaire illustrates the incongruity of Pangloss's philosophy through a series of events that illustrate great human suffering, both natural and man-made. Amidst these calamities, Pangloss persists in his philosophical musings, asserting that these events are for the best. For instance, when Jacques drowns, Pangloss halts Candide from rescuing him, explaining that the earthquake and shipwreck were specifically intended to result in Jacques's death in Lisbon harbor. This incongruity becomes even more striking when, earlier in the novel, Candide encounters his old master Pangloss, now a ravaged old 'tramp' from Westphalia, who remains optimistic despite his dire circumstances. Pangloss rationalizes that if it were not for syphilis, there would be no chocolate in the world. Through such complete absurdity, Voltaire effectively challenges the notion of thoughtless optimism.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

He has been widely acclaimed as the witiest and most perceptive authour of the 'roman philosophique'.

This doctrin of divine providence carried many prestigous names in its list of followers, such as that of John Locke, a very influential English philosopher of the period. Optimism stated that, as the world was created by god, ,who is a perfect being, all that happens in it must be for the best. All individual suffering must be attributed to the general good.\n\tVoltaire's experiences and knowledge did not allow him to adopt this theory.

It is in the course of this journey that Voltaire shows us how abhorrent the climate of optimism was to him, an optimism which often was simply an excuse for the lethargy of contemporary society.\n\tThe story begins with Candide comfortably installed at the mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten Tronkh. Here, he is taught the philosophy of optimism by Pangloss, whose maxim is: \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible'.\n\tAt the mansion in Westphalia, Candide falls in love with the beautiful Cun\u00e9gonde, and because of this love he is thrown out of the house and forced to wander. He does not however forget what Pangloss has taught him, and na\u00efvely beleives in this philosophy almost to the end of the book. Candide experiences many things which would make anyone else turn away from the philosophy of optimism but he goes on vainly beleiving that  \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux'.\n\tFor example Candide is pressganged into joining the army and here he witnesses a bloody battle, where each side claims to be the victor having caused immense damage, and supposed heroes no worse than marauding rapists. Having survived this battle Cun\u00e9gonde moves on through to Holland, where he meets again his friend and teacher Pangloss, who is almost dead of the pox, which he caught from Paquette, who in turn had traced it back through a long line, including several churchmen. Pangloss himself, although in this sorry state, still maintains his optimism, and together they journey to Portugal. Here once again they suffer terribly, first of all their friend is killed by a vicious sailor, and they arrive in Lisbon to find it in the midst of a terrible earthquake which kills many thousands of people. Somehow Candide manages to conclude that this must be part of some divine plan, although he is possibly beginning to have some doubts.\n\tHis optimism is however renewed on his arrival in South America. The na\u00efve Candide remarks on how the sea and climate are much better here than in Europe and so decides that this must certainly be\n\t'le meilleur des mondes possibles'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In Voltaire's \"Candide,\" we observe Candide, the protagonist, on a transformative journey filled with bizarre episodes. Throughout this odyssey, Voltaire illustrates the profound abhorrence he feels towards the climate of optimism that often served as a convenient excuse for the stagnancy of contemporary society.\n\nThe narrative commences with Candide residing in the grand mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten-Tronkh, where he is introduced to Pangloss's philosophy of optimism with the famous maxim: \"Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible.\" At the Westphalia mansion, Candide falls deeply in love with Cun\u00e9gonde, an event that leads to his expulsion and forced wandering. Despite the harsh realities he encounters, Candide remains unshaken in his faith in this philosophy, clinging to the notion that \"Tout est pour le mieux\" even in the face of overwhelming adversity.\n\nCandide's journey is replete with experiences that would typically shatter the optimism of a more discerning individual. For instance, he is forcibly conscripted into the army, witnessing a brutal and senseless battle where both sides claim victory. In Holland, he reunites with Pangloss, who is near death from syphilis, and continues to espouse his optimistic view despite his dire condition. Together, they venture to Portugal, where they endure further trials, including the execution of Candide's friend at the hands of a brutal sailor and the devastating Lisbon earthquake that claims thousands of lives.\n\nAmidst these calamities, Candide's optimism is reignited in the Americas, where he finds the sea and climate preferable to those of Europe. Naively concluding that this must be \"le meilleur des mondes possibles,\" he fails to see the truth behind the suffering and chaos that surrounds him.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

He was not necessarily against Leibniz, Shaftesbury and Wolff even though he ridiculed their standardized terminology, but utterly opposed the perversions of this doctrine which offered the contrary. Such perversions turned this philosophy of hope into one of despair.\n\n\tVoltaire used pessimism as the main stream of attacking the philosophical doctrine of optimism. In this he includes suffering and misery which abound in the book.\n\n\tMartin is the character which Voltaire uses to represent pessimism, the view that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil and that everything that happens is for the worst. He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cun\u00e9gonde again. It is this hope which helps him to complete his life long journey.\n\n\tConversly, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory - 'all is best in the best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best'. He was Candide's tutor, who stood by this doctrine, in spite of all his sufferings - his own hanging, flogging and dissection. Such thinking angered Voltaire that good always comes out of evil particularly since the recent events of his day distrusted him so greatly - a disaster such as the earthquake at Linis and Lisbon in which thousands of people perished. How can that contribute to the common good?\n\n\tEvery character involved in the book has endured much suffering including Candide himself. In a sense, he was blinded by following the illusion of the love of his life, lady Cun\u00e9gonde, who he planned to marry one day. Voltaire presented her as an object of desire, the only reason why Candide continued on his journey but when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed. She had changed in beauty and personality, she had become unbearable to live with. The point Voltaire wished to make was that supreme happiness was unobtainable.\n\n\tHe also attacked the philosophy by showing that goodness/kindness is never recriprocated eg. Jacques, the Anabaptist, considered as a good man, saved a sailor from drowning during a tremendous storm as they approached Lisbon harbour. He himself however was swept overboard with the sailor do nothing to help. Even though Candide tried to save him, it was too late, he drowned.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Voltaire was hostile to the philosophical outlook of his day, which was the doctrine of optimism.

This pessimism is embodied in the character of Martin, who views the world through a lens of darkness and despair. Martin believes that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil, and that everything that happens is for the worst. He revels in ruining the hope of Candide, who clings to the ultimate happiness of reuniting with Lady Cun\u00e9gonde. It is this hope that sustains Candide through his long and arduous journey.\n\nConversely, the character of Pangloss embodies the optimistic theory, maintaining that \"all is best in the best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best.\" Despite his own sufferings, including his own hanging, flogging, and dissection, Pangloss remains steadfast in his belief.

The optimistic view saw evil as a necessary part of God's plan. This was to be contrasted with the proposition, of 'Manichean' Martin that the world was inherently evil and one could only but accept it. Finally there was the opinion of \"un derviche\" who believes that all metaphysical analysis and philosophy was mere idle folly, a waste of time.\n\tCandide's early life and training takes place in \"ce paradis terrestre\" of the Ch\u00e2teau de Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia. Life is idyllic and he is the model pupil for Pangloss his tutor. He believes firmly in the philosophy of life presented to him \"tout est n\u00e9c\u00e9ssairement pour la meilleure fin\", he has no reason to doubt in it, for in his enclosed world it is never put to the test.

Bulgarian war, seeing villages completely destroyed, hundreds slaughtered and even the ch\u00e2teau sacked. Still however he retains the optimistic views which Pangloss instilled in him, believing everything to be for an ultimately beneficient purpose.\n\tThe first un-optimistic views to which Candide bears witness are those of Jacques l'Anabaptist on the boat to Lisbon, but he refuses to take these on board. Neverheless his attitudes begin to change when he lives through the combined horrors of the Lisbon earthquake and the ensuing auto da f\u00e9 which cause him to expound \"si c'est ici le meilleur des mondes, que sont les autres\". However it is two more minor events that bring ??? to Candide the presence of evil and the fallibility of the optimistic philosophy. The death of Jacques l'anabaptist while saving the savage sailor who had just struck him and who proceeded to leave him to his fate has a great effect on Candide.

The second part of it is the main theme of the book. Voltaire aimed to attack this philosophy for he had realised that it was wrong. It was a reaction against his own old belief of \ngeneral progress.\n\tVoltaire goes about his subject using the evidence of facts. Candide goes through all kinds of adventures in different countries and everywhere he met evil. Voltaire wanted to show that evil - human inflicted evil was not only real but universal and thus violently attacked the principle that \"whatever is, is right\".\n\tOptimism was a philosophy developed by Leipniz. He argued that we lived in the best of all possible worlds and explained the existence of evil by saying that in creating the world, God had to add a least amount of evil, for a world that was totaly perfect is divine and not suitable for humans. Pangloss is the character that clearly represents this philosophy... He justifies all his misfortunes by claiming that they were \"un ingr\u00e9dient n\u00e9cessaire\" and just accepts them. Everything is for the best. Everything is made for a purpose and necessarily for the best purpose, for God is Benevolent.\n\tVoltaire raises questions around all these arguments. If God is benevolent why do the innocent suffer? Why do good men die? When the Anabaptist fell in the sea Candide wanted to throw himself to his rescue. Pangloss stops him explaining once again that it was meant to be so. Voltaire rejects this fatalistic attitude but wants Candide to gradually reject stated opinion, think for himself and free himself from Optimism.\n\tWhen fleeing from Europe, Candide still held strongly to Optimism. \"Nous allons dans un autre univers; c'est dans celui-l\u00e0 que tout va bien\" - He is hoping that there he'll find the best of all possible worlds.

The second part, \"l'optimisme,\" is the main theme of the book. Voltaire aimed to attack this philosophy, recognizing it as fundamentally flawed, and his work was a reaction against his own former belief in general progress. To critique this philosophy, Voltaire employs factual evidence. Candide undergoes a series of adventures in various countries, encountering evil at every turn, demonstrating that human-inflicted evil is both real and widespread. This portrayal led Voltaire to challenge the principle that \"whatever is, is right,\" thus directly attacking the doctrine of optimism.\n\nOptimism, developed by Leibniz, posited that we live in the best of all possible worlds. Leibniz explained the existence of evil by stating that in creating the world, God had to include just a minimal amount of evil to make it habitable for humans. The character Pangloss exemplifies this philosophy, justifying his misfortunes by claiming they were \"un ingr\u00e9dient n\u00e9cessaire\" and accepting them as part of a greater good. Everything, according to Pangloss, is for the best and has a purpose ordained by God.\n\nVoltaire raises numerous questions against these arguments. He challenges the notion that God is benevolent by asking why the innocent suffer and why good men die. When Candide witnesses the Anabaptist\u2019s drowning and wants to rescue him, Pangloss, adhering to his philosophy, stops him, explaining that the event was meant to be so. Voltaire rejects this fatalistic attitude and encourages Candide to question such opinions, fostering independent thought and freeing himself from the constraints of optimism.\n\nEven as Candide flees from Europe, holding onto optimistic beliefs, he maintains that \"Nous allons dans un autre univers; c'est dans celui-l\u00e0 que tout va bien\" [We are going to another world; it is there that everything goes well]. However, his hopes are quickly dispelled as he realizes that wherever he goes, greed, war, violence, and religious persecution remain universal facts.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

The book is very much the mirror image of Voltaires life as he doesn't believe in optimism. One should simply help others and live in reality within ones limited knowledge. He therefore sets out to prove these points in Candide.\n\tVoltaire's character Pangloss is the mouthpiece for philosophical optimism and what happens to him serves to denounce optimism. Pangloss believes in divine providence, what happens happens for a reason and for the good of society. It is at this point that Voltaire ridicules this idea. Pangloss contracts syphillis which when you follow it back to its origin comes from the crew of Christopher Columbus's ship when he brought chocolate back fron one of his voyages. Pangloss however claims that he doesn't mind having syphillis because otherwise people wouldn't have known what chocolate was. The reader obviously laughs at this theory of optimism and Voltaire has succeeded in proving what a stupid unethical theory it is. The fact that Pangloss remains adamant in his belief of philosophical optimism could also demonstrate Voltaire's low opinion on those who believe in it.\n\tPhilosophical optimism has the principle that all is for the best and Voltaire tackles this assumption not only through Panglosses suffering but also the suffering of innocent people who are victims. If you are stupid enough to believe in it then you deserve what fate awaits you.

When he catches syphillis he says that it is a good thing, for without the import of the disease from Southern America we would not have chocolate or cochineal. The idiocy of his argument and the dry dogma he tries to enforce on others, especially Candide, serve to ridicule optimism and denounce it as having any philosophical worth. While Candide lies dying Pangloss philosophises rather than seeking help. Following the terrible earthquake (a real contempory event) Pangloss sees it as being sent from God because those people must die. It was therefore \"for the best\". He views the drowning of Jacques, following his attempt to help a sailor in distress as also being \"for the best\". Voltaire therefore questions and rejects optimism and uses Pangloss to acheive this aim.\n\tThe character of Martin is used to introduce the opposite views to optimism, those of pessimism. Martin takes great pleasure in defeating all Candide's hopes of finding his beloved Cun\u00e9gonde again. Voltaire said that \"Martin est manicheen come moi,\" we could therefore suppose that he is a character close to Voltaire's own views and he is used to show an alternative to optimism which is more realistic.

One of the most dominant being that of Optimism.\n\tThe idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches his philosophy at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cun\u00e9gonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721. He does this by showing the illogical traversity of it which Pangloss parrots throughout the story and jutaxposes it with a catalogue of diasters and human suffering eg/ rape, pillage war. Candide travels and search for Cun\u00e9gonde and by extension happiness is tested by every possible means. At first Candide determindly follows Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but towards the end begins to doubt it and finally rejects it after meeting the Negro slave in Surinam left lying naked at the side of the road, with an arm and a leg missing, by his master. This represents a turning point, Candide becomes his own judge and rejects the idea of philosophical optimism.

The passing of the Single European Act 1986 has given the concept of an open and common market a new lease of life by adding much detail to existing provisions in the EEC Treaty. Since the Single European Act 1986 the completion of such an open common market ( ie one free market for Europe with no trade barriers) can now be seen as a reality. However, even though Britain has joined the European Communities and accepted its affects through the passing of the European Communities Act 1972, there  has arguably been a very high price paid. This of course is the loss of absolute supremacy for the English Parliament.\n\t\tThe Orthodox theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy states that Parliament cannot restrict it's own legislative omnicompetence. That is, Parliament today cannot pass laws which limit tomorrow's Parliament's legislative powers, be they restrictions on manner and form, or as in the case of the European Communities Act, restrictions on subject matter. Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law. Therefore, in the case of a contradiction between the two, European Community law must be abided by. This first aspect of Britain's membership of the European Communities has thus already shown a restriction on Britain's legal system : that of the doctrine of implied repeal. The court's view of this argument is of utmost importance; however the judges have not had to decide this point as yet.

Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law.

When Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum, the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe. When 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market, the debate flared up again, but over how far Britain should be integrated. The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant. The former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty.\n\t\tThere is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved. Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992, and the single market. Trade will be easier, with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise. There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices, along with greater freedom to travel.\n\t\tMany Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already, with decimalization, the new Euro-passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU. They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe. Further changes are forecast for Britain, effecting day to day matters, to create a \"European Standard\". This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of \"1992 and all that\". A single market requires one central institution to co-ordinate all movements of goods and policies. Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels?. Many people would not. Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ? It may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?\n\t\tEurope may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks. As the date draws nearer, the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase. They must look into the future and consider possible effects. Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?

It is also unprecedented in the history of Europe. The plans are to form a single economic market from the member nations, which would undoubtedly and unavoidably lead to political concessions on the part of Britain, if not total politically capitulation to Brussels. It is obvious that this would lead to a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as indeed for all the other member states, and that is to say that there would be a loss of national government power in favour of a central European institution of policy making. This would cover four main areas of British society, i) economic, ii) political, iii) defence, and iv) legal.\n\t\tAs far as economics is concerned, British independant economic policy would be undermined, primarily as being in a monetary union with other states would lead to a loss of the exchange rates as a method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain. The British government would no longer be in a position to devalue or revalue the pound, to regain competitiveness with our European neighbours. This could mean Britain becoming an unproductive backwater in Europe. The Bank of England would also loose the right to print and distribute an independant currency, ie. the pound, and the British government would loose power over all monetary  policy, as there would be a single European exchange rate, interest rate, and inflation rate. This is because the supply of money would be controlled by a central European bank, having jurisdiction over these variables. This would render Britain with only fiscal policy to control her economy, but there are even rumours that this may also be centralised in a new Europe, embracing everything from tax policy to social security payments.\n\t\tAs a natural cosequence of this, there would be a political loss of sovereignty, because if there is no way that British instructions can exercise their power, they may as well not exsist.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\".

Provide only the final essay.\n\nThe Single European Act, signed by the twelve European Community member states in February 1986, represents a commitment by all the member countries to achieve a single market in goods, services and capital before 1992. Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union. As the title implies, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in Britain towards fuller integration with Europe is the belief that it will imply a loss of sovereignty for the elected government. In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.\n\t\tThe Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.\n\t\tBritain's reputation in Europe on these issues is not an enviable one. If her image in the foreign press represents any kind of standard, she is seen variously as the most obstructive, bellicose, insular power, thwarting the path of progress, with Margaret Thatcher, the most insular Brit of all, at the helm.\n\t\tPerhaps it is not an unfair image. Although Margaret Thatcher is no longer leading the country, the position of most British politicians on the European issue appears extremely ambiguous. Very few members of parliament are willing to openly and unreservedly affirm their support for the idea of a fully integrated Europe.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The Single European Act, signed in February 1986 by the twelve European Community member states, represents a commitment to establishing a single market in goods, services, and capital by 1992.

The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard to define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public. A great fear of losing our sovereignty has stemmed from the varying theories of what \"1992\" entails, and from many people's wish to remain ignorant of current developments.\n\t\tThe most evident implication of the single market is, in my view, the abolition of trade and customs barriers. This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is ever introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to \"buy British\", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result. Similarly, British firms might look for new products in other countries if they are no longer constrained by tariffs, bringing more diversity to their product range and therefore enhanc?? profits.\n\t\tBut the question of the single currency is itself a subject of much controversy. I believe that it is an aspect which is more threatening to British sovereignty than the general concept of the single market. Somehow, the prospect of treating Europe as one market is more acceptable if the countries participating keep their individual currencies and hence their identities. However, the idea of all the states using one currency is generally regarded as being a much greater threat to sovereignty, and would mean, to many people, the sacrificing of their pound to suit the aims of the Europeans.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The single European market now seems to be inevitable, although many differing views and interpretations of the idea still abound.

This will extend our free market economy across Europe, or at least to the participating nations. The consequences of this barrier removal can be viewed from both perspectives. For British firms that rely on international trade, the single market presents a significant incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. Moreover, the anticipated launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use will make it more convenient to move goods across borders.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will face increased competition or even dominance from European rivals. Should a single European currency eventually be introduced, it is believed that European firms will gain a new incentive to \"buy British,\" as foreign exchange requirements will be eliminated. This could potentially improve the UK's balance of payments. Additionally, British firms might seek out new products from other countries, which could enhance their product range and profits.\n\nThe introduction of a single currency, however, is a subject of much controversy. I believe it poses a greater threat to British sovereignty compared to the general concept of the single market. The idea of treating Europe as one market is more palatable if each participating state retains its individual currency and thus its distinct identity. Conversely, the notion of all states using a single currency is generally seen as a much greater threat to sovereignty, as it could lead to a perceived sacrifice of the pound in favor of European aims.\n\nIn summary, while the single European market is becoming increasingly certain, the path towards its full realization is likely to be fraught with challenges, particularly concerning the adoption of a unified currency. These matters will continue to shape public opinion and political debate in the coming years.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could use their own currency without having to pay such things as import tax.

Suggestions have been put forward for the adoption of the present system to one central legislative power for Europe as a whole. This idea does not seem acceptable to the British public.

There are those who feel that Britain should join Europe and enter into \"The Single Market\". But, on the other hand there are those who believe that Britain's sovereignty is far too important to abandon it. We must now consider the pros and cons of Britain joining \"The Single Market\".\n\t\tIn general we are already closely linked with the rest of Europe. Some believe that all that seperates us is the Channel. Soon, of course, this will become even less of a barrier with the completion of the \"Channel Tunnel\". When this tunnel, which will run under the water between England and France, is finally completed ( hopefully in the near future) it will be much easier to travel to and from Europe. The European countries will become more accessible. This is merely one step towards \"The Single Market\". There are also plans concerning trade barriers.\n\t\tSome people intend to drop all the barriers where trade and commerce are concerned. In this respect, it would become much easier to obtain items from Paris or Rome and a lot quicker. Imports and exports will also become more frequent and popular. We will be able to sell our goods from Britain to a wider range of customers in several more countries, just as, in the same way, we will also have the ability to buy more goods from a wider background. Buying and selling will become very important in \"The Single Market\" just as business will. Perhaps it will also be possible to accumulate shares from German or Spanish business and they, vice versa.\n\t\tIn order to aid \"The Single Market\" there are proposals at present, to introduce one monetary system into Europe, including Britain. If this becomes the case, there are those who believe that buying and selling and even travelling will become less difficult. The introduction of one monetary system would certainly ensure that the majority of problems concerning world-wide money comparisons would almost be abandoned.\n\t\tHowever, there are, of course, those who object to this one monetary system; Margaret Thatcher being one of the many. They believe that if Britain signs away the sterling and becomes part of \"The Single Market\" that her sovereignty would be lost.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "With 1992 rapidly approaching, the debate over Britain's sovereignty in relation to Europe has become increasingly urgent. On one hand, some argue that Britain should join \"The Single Market\" and integrate more closely with the European Union. Conversely, others contend that Britain's independence is too vital to risk. It is imperative to weigh the pros and cons of such a move.\n\nIn general, Britain is already deeply interconnected with Europe. Some view the Channel, which currently serves as a geographical barrier, as merely a minor obstacle. The upcoming completion of the \"Channel Tunnel,\" scheduled for the near future, will significantly reduce travel time and distance between the UK and Europe, making European countries more accessible. This development is a crucial step towards \"The Single Market,\" which extends beyond mere travel.\n\nAdditionally, plans for the removal of trade barriers show promise for increased economic integration. If trade barriers are eliminated, it will become easier to import goods from cities like Paris and Rome, and exports will increase as businesses can access a broader market. This shift will benefit consumers and producers alike, with the ability to sell and purchase goods from a wider range of sources. The integration of financial markets, including the potential for shared stock investments across borders, will further enhance the interconnectedness of the European economy.\n\nAnother proposal for \"The Single Market\" is the introduction of a unified monetary system for Europe, which includes Britain. This monetary unification could streamline transactions, travel, and overall economic activity, eliminating the complexities of currency comparisons. Proponents argue that a single currency would simplify financial dealings and make cross-border transactions smoother and more efficient.\n\nHowever, not everyone is in favor of these changes. Margaret Thatcher, among others, is a vocal opponent of abandoning the British pound and becoming part of \"The Single Market.\" They fear that losing the sterling would erode Britain's sovereignty, arguing that full integration into the European market could compromise the country's autonomy and decision-making powers. The potential loss of control over monetary policy and economic management is a significant concern for those who value Britain's independence.\n\nIn summary, the path to \"The Single Market\" presents both opportunities and challenges. While the integration of trade, financial markets, and potentially a unified currency holds the promise of economic prosperity and increased interconnectedness, it also comes with risks, particularly for those who prioritize national sovereignty. The debate remains complex, and the decision must be carefully considered to ensure that Britain's future in Europe aligns with its national interests and values.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most; Political Union, followed by Economic and Monetary Union. In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead to many disputes within the present government. They also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher. In losing her, have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty\u00a0? Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back, \"not letting socialism in by the back door\", instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community. Great Britain cannot afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present, and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes. So, a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable, whether we like it or not. On monetary and economic Union, I don't feel that we have much to lose; in fact on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously, especially in the light of 1992. If only the issue were presented in a more positive light, perhaps with some modifications, I am sure that the British public would give their agreement. After all, how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international Stock Exchanges of New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt ? Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference\u00a0? Did not the \"Big Bang\" in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plummeting ? World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked; the effects of which often see no physical borders. I therefore see this European Unity as a natural process in World development, something which should be made easier rather than hindered. Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ? \n\t\tThe issue of Political Union is still more disputed. Yes, we have a Queen and what would happen to her - would she be forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?\nThis is a very typical misinformed and ignorant statement posed by certain British \"patriots\".<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The European Union (EU) encompasses two primary forms: Political Union and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). These concepts have become particularly contentious in the UK, leading to significant internal governmental disputes and, notably, contributing to Margaret Thatcher's resignation. These issues have raised concerns about the erosion of British sovereignty, with the EU pushing for change while the UK has sought to maintain a more detached stance. Could we not have played a more active role in shaping the decision-making processes within the European Community, rather than passively accepting changes?\n\nIn the current economic climate, Great Britain cannot afford to be a minor player in a \"two-speed Europe,\" especially during a period of recession. This has led to top governmental disputes and a growing sense that British sovereignty is at risk. While the transition to an Economic and Monetary Union might seem daunting, I believe it offers substantial benefits. The 1992 crisis provides a stark reminder of the vulnerability of financial systems, and the potential risks of global interconnectedness. Would the loss of sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank truly be as significant as losing control to the international stock exchanges of New York, Tokyo, and Frankfurt? The \"Big Bang\" in 1987 demonstrated how quickly financial markets can destabilize, and the world has only become more interconnected since then.\n\nThe issue of Political Union remains intensely debated, with some questioning the fate of the British monarchy. However, this is a misinformed and ignorant statement often made by those who harbor a misguided sense of national pride. The EU is not seeking to undermine the British monarchy but is instead focused on creating a more integrated and cooperative Europe. By engaging more proactively, the UK can ensure it remains an influential and active participant in European affairs.\n\nUltimately, the EU's evolution is a natural part of global development, and we should work towards facilitating this process rather than hindering it. The UK cannot afford to delay or resist these changes; to do so would be to jeopardize its future role in a globally integrated world.", "speed": 0.45172422102672843, "eta": "00h13m01s"}

It would be impossible for her to retain all that she has built over the last few centuries.\n\t\tThe conceptofa singleEurope creates too many problems for the average person in Britain to perceive. The public are used toregarding Britain as isolated in that we tend to view the rest of the european continent from the safety of our position on the other side of the Channel. We segregate ourselves, in that we are an island, having no real frontiers between us and other nations.\n\t\tThis has already changed, however, as the Channel Tunnel is well under way. Having made physical contact by drilling the same tunnel and meeting halfway, we have created an era where it could be said, that we in Britain, are no longer living on an island. Of course this is not true, as we still live on what is geographically an island. However, soon we will be able to drive to Europe, without, in theory, even seeing the sea.\n\t\tThat first contact was a monumental moment in history, as it indicates a physicallink. Prior to this we have had many contacts with Europe and with the 1972 European Communities Act, which we signed in1973, Britain hasalready gone some distance towards losing her sovereignty.\n\t\tIf sovereignty depends on a nation making her own laws, and therefore deciding her own future, by running affairs independently of all others, then Britain has indeed lost much of her independence even now.\n\t\tAll EEC laws apply to all members and therefore even though something may not be British law it stands in our country and can actually be enforced here by a European court.\n\t\tThis is where one of the greatest problems lies, as the British are so proud of their own legal history. Much of our law is judge made and therefore many legal disputes have deep rooted decisions and remedies. As other European Countries have constitutions, most of them have a civil law system, and all of their laws are laid out on paper.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "If the states of Europe were to be unified, Britain would undoubtedly face the loss of her sovereignty, a reality that would be hard to accept after the centuries of national autonomy she has built.

The Channel Tunnel, now nearing completion, signifies a physical link between Britain and Continental Europe. By driving through this tunnel, Britons will soon be able to access Europe without ever seeing the sea, marking a significant shift in our sense of isolation. Although we remain geographically an island, this new connection symbolizes a growing interdependence.\n\nThe symbolic first contact via the Channel Tunnel is a monumental moment in history, indicating a physical link that has been absent for centuries. Prior to this, Britain had already taken significant steps towards losing sovereignty, joining the European Economic Community in 1973 with the signing of the European Communities Act in 1972. Even without full unification, Britain has already conceded much of its independence.\n\nSovereignty, defined as a nation\u2019s ability to make its own laws and shape its own future independently, has already been compromised. European Economic Community (EEC) laws apply to all members, and these laws, whether or not they are British legislation, can be enforced in British courts.

However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States. When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America, they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity. They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force. A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that, for example in military matters, the central government spoke for all. It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states, but no-one would challenge the fact that, on matters external to the United States, the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body.\n\t\tIn Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force. However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities (such as was seen over Europe's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute), the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place. Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty, but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament, something which no state in the United States could lawfully do. We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide.\n\t\tThe supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged. Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty. Even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever, it could tomorrow repeal all those laws.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "It would be tempting to equate the various European Communities with an embryonic United States of Europe, particularly when listening to politicians emphasize the importance of European unity. However, it is crucial to recognize that Europe is far from achieving anything resembling the United States. When the original 13 American states decided to form what is now the United States, they aimed to create a unified political and economic entity. They were willing to surrender significant sovereignty to ensure that the newly established national government could act as a cohesive political force on the international stage. A delicate balance was struck in the constitution, allowing individual states considerable self-governance while ensuring the central government could speak with one voice, especially in matters of military and foreign policy. It is true that today, there are still disputes over state sovereignty and attempts to regain some power, but no one would question that the federal government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body for external matters.\n\nIn Europe, there is a clear desire to see a political union of countries to create a formidable international military force. However, it is equally evident that the European Communities were initially conceived as purely economic entities. While there may be some unified political action, such as seen in the European response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute, membership in the European Communities entails a loss of national sovereignty. Notably, the United Kingdom could leave the European Community through a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament, something no state in the United States could lawfully do. A single Parliament with power to make political decisions for all Western European countries is still far from reality, and even with the approaching 1992 deadline and the establishment of a single market, the gap between the UK and Europe remains wide.\n\nThe supremacy of Parliament in the UK will never be challenged. Its authority to create and repeal any law, whether made domestically or by Europe, ensures that the UK retains full sovereignty. Even if Parliament were to enact laws today that would fully unite it with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty permanently, it could rescind these laws tomorrow. This robust parliamentary sovereignty underscores the significant differences between the current European framework and the integrated political entity of the United States.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

But this prerogative power does not include the power to alter the rights of individuals within the UK. If alterations to British law are required by the Treaty, an Act of Parliament must be passed. If Parliament fails to pass any legislation required by a Treaty then it may be in breach of its international obligations as imposed by that Treaty. This represents a loss of sovereignty as Parliament is bound to a certain extent in that Parliament is obliged to legislate under the constraint that if does not the UK will be in breach of its international obligations.\n\t\tParliament's freedom to legislate is not in theory fettered by such a Treaty. An Act of Parliament is enforceable by British courts even if it is in breach of Britain's treaty obligations. However in interpreting statutes the court will wherever possible interpret so as to conform with international law.\n\t\tThe EEC however is a distinctive Community compared with other international organisations in that it has its own broad executive and legislative powers and judicial powers for creating and enforcing Community Law, for example Regulations made by the Council of Ministers, which are directly applicable in all member states. In 1963 the European Court of Justice stated that \"... the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law, for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only member states but also their nationals\".

This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal, technical and physical barriers. This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country, an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications. There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system.\n\t\tDespite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman, namely Lord Cofield, there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market, shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers, whereas Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.\n\t\tIn accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. Consequently the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national is inevitably a problem. One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties. However these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals, so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual, he cannot place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom, by an Act of Parliament. This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law, so that to a certain extent, a degree of sovereignty is retained. Yet, this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear, for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law.\n\t\tPersonally, I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation, movement, work and many other realms, there are also many disadvantages in store, including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The Single European Act, signed in February 1986 by the Heads of Government of the 12 Member States of the European Community and which came into force on July 1, 1987, aimed to create a single market by the end of 1992.

In contrast, Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.\n\nIn line with Britain's Constitutional Law, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national, poses a problem. One of Parliament's prerogative powers is the right to make treaties. However, these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals. As a result, where a treaty contains provisions granting rights and duties to an individual, they cannot rely on it until it is substantially incorporated into British law by an Act of Parliament. This serves as a curb on the enforcement of European Community Law, allowing for the retention of a degree of sovereignty. However, this is not as advantageous as it may initially appear, as there is a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law.\n\nPersonally, I believe that while the integration of Britain into Europe will undoubtedly bring numerous benefits, such as freedom of transportation, movement, and work, there are also significant disadvantages, including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

How has this affected our sovereignty ? Until 1986 each member had the power of veto so that no new law could be passed without full agreement. In a way this did not affect our sovereignty.

Weary of invasion or interference from outside, this type of mentality can be seen amongst the British even today. Therefore, when discussing the idea of a single Europe, the British feel under threat.\n\tAs the year 1992 comes closer, \"a new pawn for Europe\", there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding what will actually happen. In Britain, there has been little emphasis on the involvement for everybody in a single Europe. Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers even, but not really, the average person on the street.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. But the extent to which this happen depends on the role and the power of the european Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps, a single currency, so this of course would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an \"advisory committee\" for the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc, will be seen as merely an extension of the E.E.C. and nothing more. But if the majority of legislation were to come from Brussels, then I think the British would feel a great loss of sovereignty and even resentment.\n\tObviously, a united Europe is not going to erase centuries of culture to form one identifiable \"European culture\"; but this might always be a worry for the British, (and probably, for other countries too). Thus a loss of power for the British Parliament would probably be seen as the first step of this \"merging together\". Nevertheless, one should not forget the role of the citizens. If they do not want to \"become European\" then they will not do so. They would have to respect the European Parliament, but in every other way life could carry on as normal. It goes without saying that they would want to take advantage of, say, better trade agreements between countries, cheaper holidays etc, but I can not envisage a mass exodus across the Channel.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Britain, as an island nation, has always experienced a type of isolation unique among European countries.

The extent of this loss depends significantly on the role and the power of the European Parliament. There are already numerous proposals for breaking down national barriers, possibly even a single currency, which would certainly help foster a European identity. However, if the European Parliament acts more as an advisory committee without enforcement power, the loss of sovereignty would be minimal. The removal of barriers and potential currency unification would simply extend the European Economic Community (EEC) and would not represent a substantial shift.\n\nConversely, if a significant portion of legislation were to originate from Brussels, the British would likely feel a substantial loss of sovereignty and perhaps even resentment. A European identity is not likely to erase centuries of distinct national cultures, but the prospect of such a change could remain a source of anxiety for the British, and possibly other countries.\n\nA united Europe is not destined to erase centuries of distinct cultures, forming a single, identifiable \"European culture.\" Yet, a loss of national power could be perceived as a step toward such a \"merging together.\" However, it is essential to remember the role of citizens.

Sovereignty, originally invested in the Crown, today stems by convention from Parliament, which is traditionally believed to be legislatively supreme. As there is no written, or codified constitution in the U.K., which has a higher status than that of ordinary law, Parliament can theoretically make or unmake any law whatsoever. In the words of the known jurist Dicey : <\"     \">. All this shows that, by the orthodox, traditional approach, as it is considered impossible to bind subsequent governments as to the procedure or manner and form of legislation, it is impossible for entrenchment of statute to occur. Unification would by implication involve a universal european adoption of common laws, in order to provide compatibility between the individual constituent nation states, and in order for those laws to be recognized by the courts of this country, these laws would need to be adopted in the U.K. in the ordinary way, ie. by enactment of Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would see this as a \"loan\" of sovereignty rather than a \"loss\", for they would claim that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy the U.K. might seize back this sovereignty by repealing the european statutes, in the ordinary way.\n\tIt could be claimed that the U.K. made its first steps to unification when it joined the European Community (E.C.) by the enactment of the European Communities Act 1972. If one considers whether, by adopting this Act, the U.K. has lost some sovereignty, or  ????? \"loaned\" it, it will be possible to predict what effect subsequent legislation pertaining to the formation of \"a single Europe\" would have on the sovereignty of this country.\n\tSeveral reasons have been put forward as to why the European Communities Act 1972 cannot be normally repealed, and that the U.K. has lost sovereignty. It has been suggested than when the U.K. joined the E.C., a new order had been created. Within that new order Parliament is no longer all powerful and cannot amend or repeal any statute by which that order is established.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In order to determine whether Britain, or more accurately the United Kingdom, would lose sovereignty in the event of European unification, it is necessary to first discuss the current nature of sovereignty in the country and how it might be affected in the future. Sovereignty, which was originally vested in the Crown, today conventionally stems from Parliament, which is traditionally believed to be legislatively supreme. Given that the United Kingdom has no written or codified constitution, Parliament can theoretically make or unmake any law whatsoever. As Dicey famously stated, \"the ultimate legal right of the Crown to command the subjects in the exercise of their private rights, and the ultimate legal right of Parliament to make or unmake any law whatever, are the distinguishing marks of the sovereignty of the state.\" This shows that, under the orthodox, traditional approach, it is considered impossible to bind subsequent governments in terms of the procedure, manner, or form of legislation, making it impossible for statutory entrenchment to occur. Unification would imply a universal adoption of common laws to ensure compatibility among the individual constituent nation states and for these laws to be recognized by the courts in the UK, they would need to be enacted through an Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would argue that this is merely a \"loan\" of sovereignty, not a \"loss,\" as they believe that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy, the UK could repeal these European statutes in the ordinary way and reclaim its sovereignty.\n\nWhen considering the enactment of the European Communities Act 1972, which brought the UK into the European Community (EC), it appears that the UK has taken a significant step toward integration. Whether this Act signified a loss of sovereignty or a \"loan\" can help predict the impact of future legislation related to a unified Europe. Several arguments have been made suggesting that the 1972 Act cannot be repealed due to the creation of a new order that limits Parliament's power. It has been proposed that upon joining the EC, the UK entered a new constitutional order, in which Parliament is no longer entirely supreme. This implies that any statutes establishing this new order, such as the European Communities Act, cannot be amended or repealed by Parliament.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

Ever since 1066, the last time that any foreign people successfully conquered British soil, the English (and later, the \"British\") have always been the conquerors. In the early Middle Ages, around the times of Edward I, II and III, the English Kings ruled large areas of France, and later in history during the reign of Queen Victoria the British Empire came into existence. With the granting then of independance to the colonies Britain was restricting her sovereignty, for which special Acts had to be passed to enable her to do this, but Britain has always retained absolute sovereignty over our own destiny. We have always been our own people, never accepting any higher power (NB we broke away from the power of the Catholic church, and the authority of Rome in Tudor times). But now we are faced with the \"threat\" or the \"opportunity\" of Europe - the actuality of being an integral part of a greater \"being\", part of a Single Europe with the many advantages it brings, but also the disadvantages, such as the loss of sovereign power.\n\t\tAs can be shown by the development of many, if not most of the individual states, much grater things can be achieved if small communities are brought together, to pool their common resources and form a single sovereign state which common aims, target and by necessity : laws. Economically, working collectively is the best way to achieve highest productivity. Different countries achieve this in different ways, ranging from a state system in which the institutions are very centralised, to a confederal system in which only certain decesions  are made by the central body. The central body under each system has a varying amount of power given to it ; each constituent communities retains a varying amount of power under the differing system. A \"Single Europe\" could follow any of these patterns, although so far it is headed towards a very lose form of confederacy, and is most likely to remain that way.\n\tIf the Communities of Europe are to achieve highest productivity, and harmonisation, the cooperation and coordination are required.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The mentality of the British is that of an island race, with a long history of being the conquerors since the last successful foreign conquest of their soil in 1066.

The diversity of the cultures, languages and political structures present in these nations mean that unification will lead to complex problems on national and international levels.

There is a conflict between federalist nations like Germany and those who wish for a more loosely structured Europe and slower reforms, which seems to be the view of our present government in Britain.\n\tThe fears of European federalism which are expressed by many of our leading politicians and legal figures stem from the idea that the sovereignty of our Parliament is paramount.

This has led to two interpretations of Community Law with the European Court of Justice consistently ruling that Community legislation must be applied uniformly throughout the member states.\n\tHowever the argument goes beyond these doctrinal questions. Many people are worried about the lack of democratic control over the Community decision making process and the voting systems used to enact legislation. Another problem is the intention of the Community organs to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of its Member States with a view to promoting the development of Europe as a whole, and in particular reducing the disparities between  the various States and in particular those with the weakest economies, for example Italy. This means legislation must be adopted to further these aims and this means that by joining the Community Britain has undertaken to implement necessary legislation within its sphere of influence. This obviously means that Britain has limited its legislative sovereignty in some areas.

On the other hand, it challenges Britain's ability to maintain its unique economic policies and potentially exposes its industries to more stringent standards and regulations.

Most people see the advantages of what a single Europe has to offer. And why not ? after all it means a freer movement around Europe, access to more jobs, education, markets and so on. However when it comes to the subject of sovereignty, there are those who lift a hesitant finger. But is everyone clear on what sovereignty means ? Sovereignty is the effective control over a defined territory and people, it must be recognised by other sovereign states, but most important of all a sovereign state recognises no higher authority.\n\tTaking these prerequisites into account, there is no question about the first two , but one only has to look at what is happening to recognise a clear erosion of sovereignty on the third point. On economic matters, I could not really see what the debate was about on whether to have a central European Bank and how, as far as I am concerned the Bundesbank does a very good job of it at the moment. When Germany decides to increase or decrease its interest rates the other countries have to respond whether it is in their interests or not.

Any powers granted to a European government will surely have to be offset by a loss to national government.\n\tThe European Monetary System for example provides a more rigid structure for Europe than individual governments will have been used to.

It cannot for example devalue its currency beyond a certain narrow band, as it may have done before when attempting to improve domestic industries competitiveness, faced with international competition.\n\tThe loss of customs barriers within Europe in 1992 will, in the eyes of many people, threaten Britain's sovereignty. Internal barriers will be removed in favour of a common barrier to protect Europe as a whole. Doubts have already been cast on some countries'ability to prevent for example illegal immigration and drug trafficking. This form of unification will affect Britain especially, since Britain's position in Europe has always been made slightly different by the fact that it is an island. Steps towards unification (following closely the building of the Channel Tunnel) will be seen in many quarters as encroachments on this \"special\" situation.\n\tThe measure that will probably cause the most consternation amongst the general public of Britain will be the European Currency Unit (if it is ever widely implemented). This would affect everyone in Britain, so it would probably be the most widely opposed move. (People may not notice more important edicts from Brussels wearing away their government's power, but they will certainly notice what's in their pockets).\n\tA single Europe will surely mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain, assuming we take sovereignty to mean simply freedom for a country's national government to act in all three of its branches, (executive, legislative and judiciary) without outside interference (in this case, from the European parliament and other bodies).\n\tHowever, this is not to say that we shouldn't strive to achieve it. A united Europe could be advantageous for everybody.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice. The           for the European Community will be the year 1992 when the internal market will be completed and trade barriers lifted and there will be common policies on social level.\n\tThis closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the devastations of World War II, closer cooperation among European states emerged on all levels, leading to the establishment of trade treaties between various countries. This development culminated in the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome, which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members, bringing the total to 12 countries today. In the future, this number may expand due to the ongoing economic changes in Eastern Europe, where more nations are transitioning towards a market economy. Negotiations among the member states have been extensive, particularly concerning the foundation of the union and the level of power to be granted to the European Communities' institutions. These include the Council of Ministers, composed of ministers from each member state; the Commission; the European Parliament, made up of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) who are democratically elected from member states; and the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe year 1992 will mark a significant milestone for the European Community, as the internal market is set to be completed, with trade barriers lifted and common social policies established. This closer union has, however, sparked concerns about the loss of sovereignty for the member states. To address this, it is essential to define what sovereignty entails. Sovereignty means that a state maintains territorial integrity, has an identifiable people and government, and exercises policies without external interference in both economic and domestic areas, as well as foreign policies. It is evident that while the sovereignty of member states remains intact\u2014allowing them to make independent decisions\u2014their ability to enact and enforce policies can sometimes be superseded by European law, which is decided by the Council and the European Parliament and applied across Europe, particularly in social matters. This is necessary to facilitate the internal market in 1992. Concern is understandable, as legislation is made by MEPs and ministers from various countries, which implies a certain loss of sovereignty for Britain. However, on vital issues such as defense and the economy, and the actual governance of the country, it is still the national governments that have the final say, ensuring that sovereignty remains a fundamental aspect of the member states' autonomy.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

It's intention is to encourage greater freedom of movement of goods and also services, capital and the workforce.\n\tThe competition for trade is in modern times so great that Britain has no choice but to join Europe in order to increase the market for its goods. Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance. European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market. The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced, hopefully to the highest common denominator.\n\tThe European does not serve only as a useful trade association, however, for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together. Co-operation between the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug-smuggling and terrorism. The common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources.\n\t However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur. The single European Act was designed to speed-up the decision making of certain institutions. The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co-operation and joint action in the areas of foreign, social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members. The decisions of the European Court of Justice already take precedence over national law, which can be seen as a major infringement of our national sovereignty. More participation in the election of members of the European Parliament would help to elect those strongest to promote British interests in Europe.\n\tThe question is how much sovereignty is Britain prepared to lose and do the benefits of belonginging to a single Europe outweigh the disadvantages. A certain loss of sovereignty has already been felt and in the next few years this will increase. As far as the immediate future is concerned a certain loss of sovereignty is the price we have to pay for material progress.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The European Community, comprising 12 sovereign European states, aims to foster closer economic and political cooperation, with a primary goal of enhancing the freedom of movement for goods, services, capital, and labor. In this intensely competitive global market, Britain has no choice but to join the European Community to increase its market access for goods. Recognized for its expertise in banking and insurance, Britain can leverage these skills in a broader European market, significantly expanding its economic reach. Moreover, the creation of a unified European commercial market will benefit consumers through the introduction of homogenized standards, ideally reaching the highest common denominator.\n\nBeyond being a mere trade association, the European Community also plays a critical role in addressing environmental challenges more effectively through collective action. Joint efforts between member states' police forces can help tackle issues such as drug-smuggling and terrorism. A common defense policy, with pooled resources, would also be advantageous and potentially more cost-effective for a large area of Europe. However, some loss of national sovereignty is inevitable. For instance, the Single European Act aimed to accelerate decision-making processes within certain institutions, requiring member governments to commit to greater cooperation and joint action in areas like foreign, social, and environmental policy. This has narrowed the scope for differing opinions among member states, and decisions by the European Court of Justice already supersede national law, which is a significant infringement on sovereignty.\n\nTo mitigate these concerns, increased participation in the election of members of the European Parliament is crucial for promoting British interests. The question then arises: how much sovereignty is Britain willing to cede, and do the benefits of belonging to a single European market outweigh the drawbacks?

One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community, made up from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community.\n\tIn 1987, the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992. This act has raised questions in Britain as to whether or not it will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain.\n\tThe lifting of trade barriers between the member states will enable the free movement of trade. This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\tBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision-making ability. The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created. It believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns, however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community was to bring in a single currency, Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality, but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange. Currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept. \n\tIf a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of its own nation, most sovereignty would be lost.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "European nations have over time been linked together both in war and peace, forming increasingly close ties on more institutional levels.

This change could limit Britain's ability to veto key decisions, leading to the imposition of European decisions on British policy.\n\nBritish sovereignty could indeed be threatened if the European Community leads to the establishment of a powerful, centralized European government. Such a government would significantly inhibit Britain's decision-making autonomy. A recent incident involving the European Parliament imposing environmental concerns on the Channel Tunnel project highlights the potential for such authoritative principles to influence British policies.

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.  As the EEC assumes ever greater proportions the debate, particularly in Britain, is centred around a potential loss of sovereignty as the member states look to integrate further.\n\tParliament is no longer the sole source of English law.  As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - that is without the interference of Parliament.  The Single European Act has given rise to more majority voting in the European instititions which means it becomes increasingly possible to introduce legislation in the U.K. to which no one here has agreed.  Certain rules of community law regarding rights and duties are directly effective.  It has been made quite clear that the courts are to apply the rules as if they were Acts of Parliament.\n\tIt is increasingly the case that Parliament legislates so the end result or the legislation is as desired by the Community.  The Community was quick enough to remind the Italians that a new legal order had been created and that pieces of community law would be directly applicable.  In short the community was reminding the Italians of the degree of transfer of sovereignty.\n\tHowever, the current European writer Collins while maintaining his support for community law and discretion is in favour of the power of Parliament to repeal the 72 Act that made Britain a member.  Lord Denning too agrees that if Britain wished expressly to repeal the E.C. Act then we could and would do just that.  The present situation can be referred to as Parliamentary self denial.  That is to say for the moment it accepts the output of Brussels but as Lord Scarmann reminds us the E.C. has force of law in Britain only because Parliament says so and he too is of the opinion that if Britain should for whatever reason want to disassociate with the Community then we could.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Upon joining the European Economic Community (EEC) and signing the 1972 Treaty of Accession, the UK was required to implement the provisions of the treaty to align English law with European standards. Simply signing the treaty meant that members were already pooling some of their sovereign rights in specific areas. Resistance to this accession came from both within and outside the UK, primarily on the grounds that Britain was already enjoying favorable trading conditions with the United States and Commonwealth countries.\n\nAs the EEC evolved into a larger entity, the debate in Britain shifted to focus on potential losses of sovereignty as member states sought greater integration. This transition highlighted the increasing influence of the EEC on national policies.\n\nParliament's role as the sole source of English law began to diminish as Britain continued to sign treaties, with regulations from these treaties becoming directly applicable to the UK without parliamentary interference. The Single European Act further enhanced this trend by introducing more majority voting in European institutions, thereby increasing the likelihood of legislation being introduced in the UK that had not been agreed upon by its representatives.\n\nCertain rules of community law regarding rights and duties became directly effective, with the courts applying these rules as if they were Acts of Parliament. This development underscored the growing integration of European law into the UK's legal framework.\n\nOver time, Parliament has often legislated to align with the desired outcomes of the Community, effectively accepting the output of Brussels. The Community demonstrated its authority when it reminded Italy that a new legal order had been created and that community law would be directly applicable, reinforcing the transfer of sovereignty.\n\nDespite this, current European writer Collins maintains support for community law and discretion, while advocating for Parliament's power to repeal the 1972 Act that made the UK a member. Similarly, Lord Denning agrees that Britain could expressly repeal the E.C. Act if it so desired. The present situation can be described as a form of \"Parliamentary self-denial,\" where for the moment, Parliament accepts the decisions of the Community, yet recognizes its ability to disassociate from the EEC if necessary. As Lord Scarman reminds us, the E.C. law's force in the UK is dependent on Parliament's affirmation, and thus Britain retains the power to realign with its sovereignty at any point.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

It is such a political powderkeg, especially for the Conservative Party - which seems to have divided itself into the two distinct factions one for and one against closer integration - that it led to the resignation of Margaret Thatcher who attempted to \"bully\" her Cabinet and Parliamentary Party into supporting her undoubtly \"Europhobic\" views.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe in a political sense would both be disadvantageous for Britain but also unworkable because of the mix of opinions and cultures that the E.C. contains.  This would mean that there would probably not be a large enough number of M.E.P.s of a particular persuasion for a single group, be it Socialist, Centre Right or Christian Democratic to hold a stable majority.  This would lead to coalitions being formed, out of necessity, across ideological boundaries which, as we have seen recently with Italy and Belgium, would lead to unstable and ineffectual governments.  A perfect example of both the effect of coalition governments and also the lack of agreement of E.C. members at the moment on such crucial issues as Defence and Foreign (ie extra-European) Policy could be seen during the Gulf War : Britain was running low on stocks of ammunition for certain types of guns and artillary in the build up to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, so it asked one of its European Community partners and NATO allies, namely Belgium, to sell it some of its stocks.  Belgium, under the premiership of Wilfred Martens refused despite the fact that Britain among others was engaged in an operation to combat the naked aggression of Iraq against its tiny neighbour, Kuwait - and what's more : the operation had the full backing of the Security Council of the United Nations.  Belgium refused to cooperate for fear of aggravating some of the extremist minorities in its country and thus splitting its coalition government.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "At present, the issue of whether Britain should become more closely integrated within the European Community is highly contentious. This divisive topic, especially within the Conservative Party, has led to significant internal strife and even the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, who tried to force her Cabinet and Parliamentary Party to support her decidedly \"Europhobic\" views. The debate centers on whether Britain should adopt a single, common currency (ECU) or pursue the more radical option of complete political unification into the United States of Europe.\n\nIn my opinion, a single, politically unified Europe would be both disadvantageous for Britain and unworkable due to the diverse mix of opinions and cultures within the European Community. This diversity would likely prevent a single group, whether Socialist, Centre Right, or Christian Democratic, from achieving a stable majority in the European Parliament (MEPs). Consequently, coalitions would inevitably form across ideological boundaries, leading to unstable and ineffectual governments. A recent example of such coalition dynamics and the lack of agreement among EU members on crucial issues can be seen during the Gulf War. Britain, engaged in Operation Desert Storm, found itself in a critical situation when it ran low on ammunition for certain types of guns and artillery. Seeking assistance from its European Community partners and NATO allies, it approached Belgium, only to be refused by Prime Minister Wilfried Martens. Despite the UN Security Council's full backing of the operation and Britain's defense of Kuwait, Belgium's government feared aggravating extremist minorities and thus could not cooperate. This incident exemplifies both the challenges of coalition governments and the deep divisions among EU members on issues like defense and foreign policy.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

Rather than forcing students to accept or reject ideas without understanding, the goal is to enable them to engage with and evaluate each theory critically. When both theories are presented with strong foundations, students learn more than just the facts; they understand the reasoning behind each perspective.\n\nBy presenting both theories, students are encouraged to think deeply and critically about the issues at hand.

Capital punishment has been carried out on\ncriminals for quite some time, but never without a strong opposition.\nMany people view capital punishment as a heinous act that is morally\nincorrect. The fact still remains that in our current society, the\nmajority of Americans support capital punishment. For every American\nthat sees capital punishment as a senseless and unnecessary act of\nviolence, there are several who believe that this sentence is the\nultimate act of justice.\nFor as long as the act of capital punishment has been around, the\narguments for and against it have also been clearly present. When forced\nto compare these arguments, it is clear that the argument opposing the\ndeath penalty is both stronger and more sensible. While it can be\ndemonstrated that both sides of the capital punishment argument have\nstrengths and weaknesses, it is the \"anti\u001edeath\" argument that\nultimately presents a more powerful case. The value of human life plays\na huge role in the arguments both for and against the death penalty. The\nfocus of this essay is to analyze the conflicting arguments concerning\nthe death penalty and to show how the value of human life is affected by\nthese arguments.\nThe arguments in favor of capital punishment revolve around the ancient\nbiblical concept of \"an eye for an eye\". For example, a criminal who\nmurders should himself be murdered to fulfill what is considered by many\nto be justice. It is most often the family members of victims who\nsupport this ideology. These feelings must be understood because of the\namount of rage that these people experience towards the perpetrator of\nthe crime. Anyone who is placed in their shoes would wish for the death\npenalty to be administered to the guilty party.

This\npresents a strong point in the argument in favor of capital punishment.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The highest sentence that can be enforced by the American judicial system is that of death.

Many see it as a morally heinous act, yet the majority of Americans support it. For every individual who views capital punishment as a senseless and unnecessary act of violence, there are several who believe that it is the ultimate form of justice.\n\nThe arguments for and against capital punishment have been present since its inception. When these arguments are compared, it becomes clear that the opposition to the death penalty presents a more compelling case. While both sides have strengths and weaknesses, the \"anti-death\" argument ultimately carries more weight. The value of human life plays a significant role in these arguments, and this essay will analyze the conflicting views on the death penalty, highlighting how the value of human life is affected by these discussions.\n\nThe arguments in favor of capital punishment often revolve around the ancient biblical concept of \"an eye for an eye.\" For example, a criminal who murders should face the same fate, a notion that many consider to be just. It is often the family members of victims who support this ideology. These feelings must be understood, given the immense rage and grief they experience towards the perpetrator. Anyone in their position would likely want the death penalty to be administered to the guilty party. Robert Hoyler, a proponent of the death penalty, supports this claim by arguing that justice demands retribution. This point is compelling but not without its flaws.\n\nOn the other hand, the arguments against capital punishment highlight the irreversible nature of the sentence. Once the death penalty is carried out, there is no chance for rehabilitation or mitigation of the sentence. Moreover, the issue of wrongful convictions looms large. The risk of executing an innocent person is a moral and ethical concern that cannot be overlooked. The proponents of the death penalty often cite the deterrent effect of capital punishment, but extensive research has shown that this is not a reliable deterrent. The emotional appeal of \"an eye for an eye\" does not address the broader implications of the death penalty on the value of human life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of \"an eye for an eye\" provides a strong emotional and ideological foundation for supporting capital punishment, the arguments against it are more compelling when considering the value of human life. The irreversible nature of the death penalty and the risk of wrongful convictions make it a less just and more problematic tool for justice compared to life imprisonment.

In fact a study done by two researchers from New\nYork found that black students did much better academically when they\nwere bused to a formerly all white school than did those black students\nwho remained at the all black school. A significant factor which\ncontributed to the success of school integration was the time in which\ntransfer students were placed into the desegregated school system.\nGenerally, children who were placed into the school system at an early\nage such as kindergarten or first grade showed greater academic\nachievement than did those who were placed in school later in their\neducation. This is because the children had more time to adapt to the\nenvironment. Furthermore, the children received little or no exposure to\nthe educational environment of the inner city thus, these transfer\nstudents who had not become accustomed to one particular style of\nlearning were more easily able to adapt to a new method of learning.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "School integration has been a contentious issue in the United States since 1954, when the Supreme Court declared in *Brown v. Board of Education* that racial segregation in schools was unconstitutional. Following this decision, the number of black students attending schools with white students increased gradually, with significant changes by 1970. At that time, 44 percent of black students in the southern region were enrolled in majority-white schools, compared to 28 percent in the northern and western states. The ethical debate over school integration centers on questions of value and consequence, aimed at determining whether integration will enhance or detract from the education of children and improve race relations.\n\nOne of the primary goals of school integration is to provide inner-city students with a higher quality of education. Proponents believe that moving students from environments fraught with crime and drugs to more conducive learning atmospheres can significantly benefit their academic performance. According to Howard Fuller's thesis, *integration can create a more equitable educational experience*. Furthermore, a study conducted by researchers from New York found that black students who were bused to formerly all-white schools outperformed their peers who remained in all-black schools. A critical factor underlying the success of school integration was the timing of the transfer. Children placed into desegregated school systems at an early age, such as kindergarten or first grade, consistently showed greater academic achievement compared to those transferred later. This is because early placement provided more time for students to adapt to the new environment, and they were less likely to have become accustomed to a specific educational style, making it easier for them to adapt to new learning methods.", "speed": 0.4771552544611403, "eta": "00h11m12s"}

Surrogacy is unethical because biologically\nthere are only two parents, excluding the adoptive mother.

Many people feel that women should be allowed to control their own\nbodies, insisting that surrogate motherhood is not just another way of\nreproduction. Health services, however, argues that <*>. By saying that\nsurrogate motherhood fulfills a human longing in the infertile couples\nlives, the author is claiming there is a void in the infertile couples\nlives. The couple who is considering surrogacy view it as simply a way\nto fill their childless void. They do not see the surrogate mother as a\nperson who has feelings, but rather as just a walking womb that will\nhelp them to have a child. In many cases the surrogate mother's feelings\nare not considered because she is strictly looked upon as a reproductive\nstructure. No human being should be looked upon as a reproductive\nstructure who has no feeling. \nThe infertile couple's needs are often deemed much more important than\nthe surrogate mother's. <*>.

Surrogate\nmotherhood fulfills the biological needs of the father to reproduce, but\nneglects those of the adoptive mother. As the article above states\ncouples who are desperate to have a child use the father's genetic\ninheritance and not the mothers. Many times the mother may feel left\nout.

The ethical question surrounding surrogate motherhood emerged prominently following the 1987 \"Baby M\" case, where the surrogate mother sought custody of the baby she had carried for another couple. This case brought to light the complex emotional and biological ties inherent in such arrangements.\n\nCritics argue that surrogate motherhood is unethical because it involves only two biological parents, excluding the surrogate mother. More fundamentally, surrogacy is seen as a means for infertile couples to fulfill their desire to parent, which can result in emotional strains and ties that often go unrecognized.\n\nMany champion the right of women to control their bodies, viewing surrogacy as an extension of reproductive rights. However, health service organizations counter that surrogate motherhood is often a commodification of human life, treating the surrogate mother as nothing more than a reproductive vessel. This perspective devalues her as an individual with her own feelings and desires.\n\nThe infertile couple often views the surrogate mother as a mere tool to fill their void, failing to acknowledge her emotional and personal contribution. In numerous instances, her feelings are disregarded in favor of the couple\u2019s needs, which is a concerning ethical stance. Annas argues against this view, asserting that the suffering of the surrogate mother is not justifiable for meeting the desires of infertile couples. The couple might perceive a biological imperative to reproduce, but this need does not justify imposing significant emotional or physical strain on the surrogate.\n\nThe emotional and physical suffering experienced by the surrogate mother can be severe. For the infertile mother in particular, there is a unique biological need to parent, which is often overlooked. For example, the article suggests that many couples prioritize the genetic inheritance of the father over that of the mother. This can lead to feelings of neglect and estrangement for the mother who did not carry the child. Consequently, the mother may feel that her role in the child\u2019s life is diminished or non-existent, questioning her right to \"care\" for the child.\n\nIn conclusion, while surrogacy offers a solution to infertility, it is fraught with ethical dilemmas that must be carefully considered.

Some people\nwould go too far. Steroids and the use of other performance enhancing\ndrugs are becoming a major problem in today's society. Steroids are\nchemical cousins of the hormone testosterone. They promote muscle growth\nand increase aggression, spurring athletes to more \u001e strenuous workouts.\nThe International Olympic Committee has already banned nearly 100\nsubstances. There are two sides to this issue. On one side are chemists\narmed with state\u001eof\u001ethe\u001eart equipment for detecting the use of such\nsubstances. On the other are many athletes determined to use any means\navailable to enhance their performance and get away with it. Drug\ntesting of all athletes is ethical and should be mandatory at any given\ntime to ensure fair competition, protect athletes' health and safety\nfrom the long term effects of steroid usage and prevent drug usage among\nstudent and professional athletes who are regarded as role models.\nMany people question whether mandatory drug testing is ethical or if it\nis a violation of athletes rights to privacy. Ethics refers to human\nconduct with emphasis on the determination of right and wrong. Using\nperformance enhancing drugs is against the rules of the National\nCollegiate Association of Athletes and professional sports associations.\nTo enforce these rules athletes must be drug\u001etested. As John Chaplin, an\nOlympic track official and veteran track\u001eand\u001efield coach pointed out,\nthe only way to clean up sports is to institute random testing.

The\narticle also points that drug testing does not infringe on athletes'\nright to privacy because the tests do not come as a surprise. Athletes\nare notified in advance that they will be tested.

The International Olympic Committee has already banned nearly 100 substances, yet the debate over drug testing in sports remains contentious.\n\nThe issue divides into two primary camps: those who advocate for rigorous drug testing and those who argue against it, often on the grounds of individual rights. On one side, we find chemists equipped with advanced technology for detecting these substances, working tirelessly to keep the playing field fair. On the other, we see many athletes determined to exploit any available means to enhance their performance and avoid detection. Mandatory drug testing of athletes is not only ethical but essential for ensuring fair competition, safeguarding athletes' health and safety from the long-term effects of steroid use, and deterring others from following suit.\n\nSupporters of drug testing argue that it is a necessary evil to maintain the integrity of sports. They contend that it is unethical for athletes to cheat for glory, whether it be a gold medal, a personal record, or a championship title. John Chaplin, an Olympic track official and seasoned coach, emphasized the need for random testing to cleanse sports of such practices, stating, \"The only way to clean up sports is to institute random testing.\" This policy would allow officials to conduct surprise drug tests at any time and place, ensuring that athletes cannot evade detection.\n\nCritics often argue that mandatory drug testing violates athletes' rights to privacy.

Each group holds different ethical values and beliefs that drive their stance. The Civil Liberties Group argues against school prayer by emphasizing the constitutional amendment of church and state. They maintain that God cannot be incorporated into or excluded from public schools, and they advocate for respect from Christian majorities towards other religions. On the other hand, the Conservative Religious Group supports the inclusion of prayer and religion in public schools for several reasons. First, they argue that it provides students with a more comprehensive understanding of history and religion. Second, they believe that it upholds the right of freedom of speech. Lastly, they claim that it can help decrease the rise in violent crime, divorce, and teenage pregnancies.\n\nDespite these arguments, two articles\u2014\"A Religious Argument Against School Prayer\" and \"Prayer in Public Schools, It's Nothing New to Many\"\u2014fall short in their reasoning and solutions. \"A Religious Argument Against School Prayer\" offers stronger backing for the Civil Liberties Group's stance, while \"Prayer in Public Schools, It's Nothing New to Many,\" written by Peter Applebome, and \"Despite Debate in Many U.S. Schools, Prayer Has Become a Part of the Day,\" by David Klinghoffer, present a biased and weak perspective in favor of prayer in schools. The Conservative Religious Group and these articles use a biased account and poor reasoning to create a weaker view on the idea of prayer in schools. One argument from this group is the idea of religion playing an important role in some education courses. As Klinghoffer states, \"religion has always been an essential part of the educational curriculum.\" While this statement provides a valid reason for maintaining religious courses in schools, it fails to address how these courses can be reintegrated into the curriculum.\n\nIn contrast, the article \"Jefferson Still Lives\" offers a more balanced and practical solution by advocating for a period of silence before class, allowing students to seek personal reflection or prayer if they choose. This approach respects the principles of the separation of church and state while providing a space for spiritual and personal development.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

Some of them\neasily justified, and some are not. These dilemmas can range from a\nsimple act of choosing which friends side to take in a disagreement, or\nsomething more serious, like a priest giving up his reconciliation oath\nand handing over a confidential confession of a murderer to the police.\nWe make most of these decisions based on our values and beliefs. One's\nvalues and beliefs tend to stem from their religious background or the\nmorals and ethics on which they were raised. It is these ethics that\ncontribute to the majority of our decision making tactics. When forming\na decision, based on ethics, we must be careful to determine which side\nis morally correct.\nA dilemma in which morals have come up more often than not is the case\nfor animal rights. Should these animals be tested for the protection of\nhuman lives, or more importantly, what gives us the right to test these\nanimals? Now, in the Bible, it says that humans were to have <*>. What\nbetter of an authority figure than God, could give us this right.\nAnimals were put on earth for humans to do with as they please, as long\nas we did not take advantage of this gift. I believe animal testing in\nmost cases is trying to save people's lives, one way or the other. The\ndecision must be made that a human's life is more important than an\nanimal's life. Animal testing is a crucial part of our society and must\ngo on, if human's want to continue as the superior species. An example\nof this, is a three year old, named Timmy Baker has a heart attack from\na disease he possibly contracted from eating an undercooked hamburger.\nHe is not responding to resuscitation efforts and his doctor, Dr Michael\nMcManus, decides to give him the epinephrine drug. The dosage\nrecommended by the medical association does not work, but Dr McManus has\nheard of the research done by Dr Traystman. In research done by\nTraystman, pigs are electronically subjected to heart attacks,\nresuscitated, and then given a dose of the drug epinephrine. This drug\nis used to help revive heart attack victims while simultaneously\npreventing brain damage from occurring. He also conducts tests\ndetermining whether additional doses of the medication can help a\nsuffering patient.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are many dilemmas that humans must face every day, some easily justified, and some not.

The Bible states that humans were given dominion over animals, suggesting that God, as the ultimate authority, might have granted us this right. According to this perspective, animals were put on earth for humans to use, provided we do not abuse them. However, I believe that in most cases, animal testing is an effort to save human lives, whether directly or indirectly. The decision must therefore be made that a human's life is more valuable than an animal's.\n\nAn example illustrates this point.

In fact, nearly all instances in which AIDS can be\ntransmitted involved a rather intimate relationship, whether that be\nbetween two sexual partners, or a mother and child. The instances of\npeople acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions has been so greatly\nreduced, that it has nearly been eliminated. Despite the very specific\ninstances in which a person can contract AIDS, many people are being\ndiscriminated against in the job market, in trying to receive health\ncare, and in applying for, or maintaining insurance coverage because\nthey have AIDS. We as a society need to start viewing these people as\nvictims of a deadly, and fatal disease, rather than as criminals, or\noutcasts of society. It is morally and legally wrong for people with\nHIV, or AIDS to be discriminated against by employers and insurance\ncompanies simply on the basis that they are afflicted with the disease.\nOne can conclude from the evidence that will be shown here that this\nkind of discrimination is happening, and that it is in fact wrong, both\nlegally and morally. The opposition offers a weak argument that the\nrights of employers and insurance companies should be paramount to the\nrights of people who are afflicted with AIDS, when it comes to deciding\nwho and who not to hire, or who and who not to insure. One will also\nclearly be able to conclude that this is in fact a fallacy that defies\nmoral and legal standards.\nAIDS as a disease is actually relatively young, and therefore is not\nfully understood. We know how people can contract the disease, and we\nknow the inevitable effects of this horrible illness when someone does\ncontract it. However in the short time that HIV and AIDS have been\naround hundreds, perhaps even thousands, have been denied a job, have\nbeen denied health insurance, and worst of all have been denied their\ndignity. A shining example of this type of behavior is the story of Mark\nWoodley. His story sounds something like this:\n<*>.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "AIDS is the most common disease of our world today, affecting countless lives.

In fact, nearly all instances of transmission involve a rather intimate relationship, such as between two sexual partners or a mother and child. The instances of people acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions have been significantly reduced and are now nearly eliminated. Despite the specific nature of how AIDS is contracted, many individuals continue to face discrimination in various aspects of their lives, including the job market, healthcare, and insurance coverage.

It is morally and legally wrong for people with HIV or AIDS to be discriminated against simply because they are afflicted with the disease.\n\nOne can conclude from the evidence presented here that such discrimination is indeed happening and is both legally and morally incorrect. The opposition's argument that the rights of employers and insurance companies should take precedence over those of people with AIDS is fundamentally flawed and defies moral and legal standards. This argument is a fallacy that cannot be upheld when considering the rights and dignity of individuals affected by the disease.\n\nAIDS, as a relatively young disease, is not fully understood. We know how the disease can be contracted and the inevitable effects it has on those who acquire it. However, in the short time HIV and AIDS have been around, hundreds, if not thousands, have faced significant challenges, including denial of employment, health insurance, and dignity. A shining example of this is Mark Woodley's story.\n\nMark Woodley's experiences illustrate the harsh realities of such discrimination.

Those who do\nfeel that way see pictures of Oliver Twist or Little Orphan Annie in a\ndreary prison for children. While over the past century, there have been\npoorly run orphanages, the vast majority were a pleasant place for\norphans to grow up. In the past decade, the question of whether\norphanages should be brought back has come to the government's and\npublics attention. There are still a few orphanages running today,\nhowever the number is no where near it was one hundred years ago. With\nthe current welfare crisis, many such as Republican Newt Gingrich feel\nthat support payments should be stopped or greatly reduced to mothers\ncontinuing to have children on welfare. The money would then be used to\nsupport orphanages. This of course would mean taking many children away\nfrom their natural parents. Opposition to the whole idea of orphanages\nrefute it mainly because of two reasons. They disagree with the break\u001eup\nof families and feel the whole policy would be too costly. While these\ntwo ideas are difficult to content with, the truth is in the numbers.\nMany children not only live in homes that cannot support them\nfinancially, but are abusive. These children are not receiving warm and\nnurturing care, but may be scarred for life. There are also too many\npeople taking advantage of the system by continuing to have children to\ngain financial support. While many feel that orphanages are a socially\nwrong solution to the welfare problem, many children have proven that\ngrowing up in one provides for a stable and nurturing atmosphere,\ntherefore orphanages should be re instituted.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "To many, the mere mention of an orphanage evokes dark and concerning images, reminiscent of Oliver Twist or Little Orphan Annie in a dreary, prison-like institution. While it is true that some poorly run orphanages in the past may have indeed been grim, the vast majority were actually pleasant and nurturing places for children to grow up. Over the past decade, the question of whether orphanages should be reinstated has gained attention from both government officials and the public. Despite the current welfare crisis, with calls from figures like Republican Newt Gingrich to reduce support payments to mothers on welfare, the number of orphanages remains a fraction of what it was a century ago. This proposal would involve taking many children away from their natural parents, a move that has sparked significant opposition.\n\nOpponents of orphanages primarily argue against the breakup of families and the high costs associated with running such institutions. While these are valid concerns, the reality lies in the numbers. Many children live in homes that are financially strained and abusive, lacking the warmth and nurturing care they need. These children are often at risk of being scarred for life. Furthermore, there are those who exploit the welfare system by continuing to have children to secure financial support. \n\nDespite the social concerns raised, the experiences of many children who have grown up in orphanages demonstrate the positive impact of such institutions. These children often grow up in stable, nurturing environments that can provide them with the care and support they need to thrive. Therefore, it is imperative that orphanages be reinstated to address the complex issues surrounding child welfare and ensure the well-being of children who need it most.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

They think of big\nbusiness; the suits, stocks and bonds, and of course the money involved.\nBusiness is not just a matter of economic exchange, money, commodities,\nand profits; it involves human interactions, is basic to human society,\nand is intertwined with the political, social, legal, and cultural\naspects of society today. What then is ethics? Ethics are the goals and\nactions people ought to perform to do what is good or right for human\nbeings. When used in business, ethics involves the relationship of what\nis right in business and its environment because business is a complex\nfabric of human relationships. It is often said that business and ethics\ndon't mix which is why business has its own rules, objectives, ethical\nstandards, and judgments to follow. In business there is more involved\nthan just making a profit and getting ahead; it involves relationships\nthroughout the business environment and there must be a sense of respect\nand trust involved or else the business will fail. \nThe relationships created in business include the union between the\nproducers and the consumers, the employers and the employees, and the\ncorporation and society. The business system of the United States is a\nfree market system which allows the producers and the consumers control\nover their end of the system. According to Fortune, <*>. This supports\nmy claim because if the producers just worry about their money and not\nbuild a relationship with their consumers, the consumers will find\nsomeone else to patronize.

However, business is more than just a matter of economic exchange, money, commodities, and profits. It is deeply intertwined with human interactions, serving as a fundamental aspect of human society. Business is also intrinsically linked to the political, social, legal, and cultural dimensions of contemporary society. At its core, what is ethics? Ethics are the principles and actions people should undertake to do what is good or right for human beings. When applied to business, ethics involve the moral considerations and responsibilities that arise within the complex web of human relationships that make up the business environment.\n\nBusiness and ethics are often perceived as being at odds, which is why businesses have their own set of rules, objectives, ethical standards, and judgment criteria. However, the reality is that merely making a profit and advancing one's own interests are not sufficient. Business involves a myriad of relationships\u2014between producers and consumers, employers and employees, and corporations and society as a whole. For a business to succeed, there must be a foundation of respect and trust throughout these relationships. Without such relationships, the business is likely to falter.\n\nIn a free market system like that of the United States, the relationship between producers and consumers is particularly crucial. According to Fortune, producers must focus not only on profit but also on building a relationship with their consumers. This is supported by the fact that consumers have the power to choose whom they patronize. If producers solely focus on their profits without fostering a relationship with consumers, the consumers will likely seek out competitors. Without consumer support, the business cannot make a profit and will eventually have to shut down. Thus, the ethical considerations in business extend beyond financial gain and are essential for the success and sustainability of any business endeavor.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

To accomplish this,\nmany universities add courses and provide new things such as research\nlabs and new cutting edge equipment. Many universities even try to\naccommodate the changing needs of the students by providing services\nsuch as free tutors and bigger staffs.\nBut not once before have I heard of a university trying to attract\nstudents with grass, trees, and a fountain. To be exact, about five city\nblocks of it, none the least. That's right, our very own Marquette\nUniversity is trying what in my opinion is one of the most unethical\nideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to attend to\ndifferent racial histories and so\u001ecalled physcological differences. This\ngreen space is supposed to create a more comfortable learning\nenvironment, but might just reverse this comfort when students see the\ncost of just under five blocks of grass. It's a whopping ten million\ndollars that the students, not the gesus, are going to pay. Even if they\ndivvy it up over twenty or so years, many students can't afford this\nincrease. I myself am barely scraping by. Plus this grass will cost\nlocals a matching ten million dollars just to reroute all of the\nutilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue.\nSome of the utilities effected by the common's project will be local\nbuses.

The\ntransit company is estimating to lose between \"$1 million and $600,000,\"\nwhich the university is trying to offset by getting students on the U\u001e\npass system. The University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this\nsystem. I feel that this won't help, considering that a large number of\nstudents that already use the county transit and contribute to the\nprofits of the county's transit.

This initiative seems particularly unethical when compared to earlier controversial moves, such as UCLA's addition of courses focused on different racial histories and perceived psychological differences.\n\nWhile the university claims that this green space will create a more comfortable learning environment, the cost of such a project might overshadow any comfort it offers. The ten million dollars is a substantial sum that students will bear, even if spread over twenty years. For many, such as myself, who are already struggling to finance our education, this additional cost will be a significant burden. Moreover, the project will require an additional ten million dollars to reroute utilities, adding to the overall expense and inconvenience for locals.\n\nFurthermore, the planned common's project will impact local infrastructure, particularly local bus routes. About three to five bus routes currently run through Marquette\u2019s planned commons area. The transit company estimates a loss of between $1 million and $600,000, and the university is attempting to offset this by encouraging students to use the U-pass system. While the University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this system, I believe it will not be effective. Many students already rely on county transit and contribute to its profits, so the university\u2019s plan to redirect students to the U-pass system may not generate the financial benefits Marquette anticipates. In fact, it might lead to a net loss for the city, as the university\u2019s intervention could disrupt the current transit system\u2019s revenue streams.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

Proponents of euthanasia argue that\nthe Declaration of Independence states life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness as rights that all American possess. Opponents of euthanasia\npresent the questions, \"does the right to your own life include the\nright to take that life as well?\" In my opinion, that should not be so.\nSimply because that there are few people who are thinking of taking\nthere own lives and are also of sane mind. If someone is having a bad\nenough struggle within themselves that they are willing to end that God\u001e\ngiven life, then it is possible that the individual is not mentally or\nemotionally stable to make that decision. So, who is to decide whether a\nlife is worth living? Who can project whether a patient in a coma will\ncome to consciousness or not? With questions such as these, there is no\nblack or white answers. There is a large gray area involved in answering\nthose questions that the law is supposed to cover. Within this paper it\nwill be shown that there are three ideas working against the practice of\neuthanasia. For one, America is not ready to allow any human being to\ntake an innocent, and in some cases a guilty individual from this world,\nwhether it be his/her own or another. The second idea is that it is too\ndifficult to determine if a person will suffer too much in his or her\nlifetime to go on living. This idea is held together by the fact that\nthere is too much gray areas within ethics and that patients or doctors\ncan not decisively determine whether a live is worth living. The third\nidea is that the \"law\" that determines whether a life is \"worth living\"\nis too vague and allows for too many shaky judgments to be made. Because\nof these reasons, euthanasia should not be allowed to be practiced as\nfreely as it is in the United States.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Although euthanasia is practiced throughout the U.S., it remains a highly contentious topic. Proponents argue that the Declaration of Independence grants all Americans the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, suggesting a right to end suffering. Opponents, however, question whether the right to life can also encompass the right to take it, raising ethical concerns. In my view, the right to life should not include the right to end it, especially when considering the mental and emotional stability of the individual. If someone is contemplating suicide, it often indicates a lack of mental or emotional stability to make such a decision. Thus, who is to determine whether a life is worth living? And who can accurately predict whether a patient in a coma will regain consciousness? These questions introduce a vast gray area that the law is not equipped to fully address.\n\nThis paper explores the three main arguments against the practice of euthanasia. Firstly, America is not yet prepared to allow any individual, whether innocent or guilty, to be removed from the world, either by their own choice or that of another. The second argument is grounded in the difficulty of determining whether a person's suffering will be too great to continue living. This is exacerbated by the ethical ambiguities and the inability of doctors to decisively determine when a life is no longer worth living. The third argument points out that the \"law\" determining when a life is \"worth living\" is too vague, leaving room for too many uncertain judgments. Given these complexities, euthanasia should not be practiced as freely as it is in the United States.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

This controversy between \"comprehensive sex education\" and \"abstinence-only education\" is not new, but opponents of abstinence-only programs have recently become particularly enraged by the claims made by their proponents. Proponents of abstinence-only education argue that by promoting abstinence, the rates of sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and teenage pregnancies would decrease. However, proponents have often used illogical reasoning or fallacies to support their ideas, rather than solid evidence. On the other hand, supporters of comprehensive sex education believe that by providing accurate information and promoting the use of protection methods, teens are more likely to listen and respect the message of abstinence. Comprehensive sex education also ensures that teens are informed about various methods to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies.\n\nMany of the suggestions made by supporters of abstinence-only education can be easily refuted with common sense. For instance, Pat Socia, an abstinence-only activist, once asked, \"How can birth control pills prevent pregnancy and STIs if teens do not use them correctly?\" This question is misleading since some of the better prevention methods ten years ago included birth control pills and hormone injections, which are highly effective when used correctly. However, these methods do not prevent the transfer of bodily fluids as effectively as condoms do. Additionally, a spokesperson for Teen-Aid, Inc., an abstinence-only program, stated that teens often lack the knowledge to use these methods correctly. According to opponents of abstinence-only education, if teens do not listen to the proponents' misinformation, the goals of abstinence-only teaching will not be achieved. Therefore, comprehensive sex education, which promotes accurate information and the use of protection methods, is taking advantage of the opponents' misinformation to gain support for their cause.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

Will they keep the child to raise and love him, or\ngive another couple that same chance? The grief faced by the biological\nparents is understandable and immeasurable, and what if they decide they\nwant that child back someday down the road? Recent cases played out in\nthe media have raised the question of rights of biological parents\nversus the rights of adoptive parents. While both sides present some\ngood arguments, neither proponents nor opponents to biological parents\nused strong values or consequences, nor attempt to change public\nopinion. Because this is so, there is still no answer as to who should\nhave rights over a child.\nBlood is thicker than water. This is the main underlying value stated by\nthe supporters of biological parents. The United States' legal system is\nbound by law to favor the biological parents unless abuse, neglect or\nabandonment can be proved. The righteousness of this point is debated\nwell by the supporters of adoptive parents. They cite a case in which an\n18 year old who abandoned her child in a hospital later got custody,\neven though she was living in a homeless shelter at the time. This is a\nsomewhat strong argument for the opponents of biological parents. Even\nthough they use a rare case as an example, it shows the inconsistency of\nour court system.

They should also cite possible\nconsequences of a wrongful decision in their eyes.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When parents bring a child into the world, they face a crucial decision: whether to raise and love the child themselves or give another couple the chance to do so. The grief experienced by biological parents is profound and virtually immeasurable, and the possibility of wanting their child back in the future complicates this choice. Recent media cases have brought to light the conflict between the rights of biological and adoptive parents, sparking debate on who should have legal custody. While both sides present valid arguments, neither camp has effectively employed strong values or consequences to sway public opinion. Consequently, the question of who should have rights over a child remains unresolved.\n\nSupporters of biological parents often invoke the principle that \"blood is thicker than water,\" emphasizing the natural and emotional bonds between parents and their children. According to the United States legal system, biological parents are favored unless abuse, neglect, or abandonment can be proven. Opponents of this stance argue that this principle is flawed and inconsistent, pointing to a case where an 18-year-old who abandoned her child in a hospital later obtained custody, despite her living in a homeless shelter at the time. This example highlights the inconsistencies in the court system and serves as a strong argument against the prioritization of biological ties.\n\nHowever, to strengthen their argument, proponents of biological parents need to delve deeper. They should explain why the court's decision in this case was unjust and provide other examples to illustrate the inconsistency. Additionally, they should outline possible consequences of wrongful decisions, such as emotional trauma for the child or the possibility of a broken family structure when custody is wrongly given to an adoptive parent.

The defense disagrees, however,\nand argues that the court should not allow the jury to hear this\nevidence during Simpson's trial because O.J. Simpson's rights as a\ncitizen of the United States were disregarded.

Suicide means the end of all problems (Though those problems\nare usually solved easily.) This topic has many sides but can be\nanalyzed with two: those who advocate rational suicide and those who\noppose it. To analyze specific values and consequences, I will only\ndiscuss the opponents of suicide. There are a vast number of reasons\nagainst attempting suicide. In one way or another, people seem to\njustify them all. People often discuss how selfish a suicide can be.\nOthers discuss the grief\u001estricken family. They feel no pity for the\nperson who committed suicide either. Yet, others speak of the\ninvolvement of religion in the lives of those that attempt and commit\nsuicide. The opponents of suicide often neglect to prove their\nstatements. All the statements that people make are good statements\nthat, with some thought, can be rationalized. The opponents simply fail\nto provide the evidence for the rationalization of their arguments.\nThe authors of the first argument fail to prove it. The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish. He does not feel that there is any\nsuicide that can be considered rational because all suicide fails to\nthink about the effects of a suicide on others. He states that <*>. Mr\nRauscher hopes to convey that the only thing that people who commit\nsuicide do is think about whether they should end their own pains. Yet,\nRauscher fails to analyze his opposition. He should ask what does the\nperson attempting suicide thinking? The person may be thinking about his\nfamily and friends when he or she attempts suicide. For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous.\nMaybe Mr Rauscher does not think about what the sight of that pain and\nthe family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their\nemotions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Many events in our lives have consequences, but few are as dramatic and far-reaching as suicide. This act marks the end of all problems; however, these problems are often solvable with effort. Suicide can be analyzed from different perspectives, but two sides are particularly relevant: those who advocate rational suicide and those who oppose it. In this essay, I will focus on the opponents of suicide and the various reasons why they argue against it.\n\nThere are numerous reasons against attempting suicide, and people justify them in many ways. One common argument is that suicide is selfish, as it disregards the feelings of loved ones. Another perspective is the grief-stricken family, who often feels no pity for the person who committed suicide. Additionally, religious beliefs play a significant role, as many see suicide as a violation of divine laws. Opponents of suicide often fail to substantiate their claims, relying on vague generalizations rather than concrete evidence.\n\nThe argument that suicide is selfish is one of the most commonly cited reasons. However, opponents rarely provide evidence to support this claim. For instance, in \"The Case Against Suicide,\" William Rauscher argues that all suicides are selfish because they fail to consider the impact on others. Rauscher contends that those who commit suicide only think about ending their own pain. Yet, this argument overlooks the complexity of human decision-making. People contemplating suicide often consider the well-being of their families and friends. For example, someone dying of lung cancer might cause more distress to their loved ones if they were alive, as the emotional pain would persist. The pain experienced by someone with a terminal illness can be enormous, and Mr. Rauscher's analysis fails to account for the psychological toll on those left behind.\n\nIn conclusion, while the arguments against suicide are often compelling, they often lack substantial evidence. Opponents frequently base their claims on generalizations and fail to consider the multifaceted nature of suicide. A more nuanced approach that accounts for the complexity of human emotions and circumstances would better address the ethical and emotional challenges posed by the act of suicide.", "speed": 0.45576188292567354, "eta": "00h10m34s"}

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers. If we recognize that a work force filled with such diversity of workers will inevitably include women - of all ages - as well as man with family responsibilities, then we see the undeniable economic connection between this \"low value\" contribution of child care providers, and the economic strength of the nation. It is not difficult to conclude that child care workers are underpaid, and the issue will be difficult to resolve without  involving employers or the government in the child care industry - which may not be the ideal solution. It is tempting to conclude with the proposal that we, as a society, consciously work to raise the status of workers who care for children - but the final irony is that, until the financial status of these workers becomes more equal, they will not be judged as making a valuable \"contribution to the society they live in.\"\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The idea that equal work should yield equal pay appears to align with the perceived values of equality in American society.

Americans value children, evident in our national focus on education and child safety laws. Yet, our society has not yet consciously acknowledged the value of labor in the child care industry. Given that society rewards valuable contributions, both economically and in terms of status, child care workers often fall short of this recognition. \n\nThis discrepancy is difficult to overlook, especially when considering the societal benefits derived from a diverse workforce.

The amount of that financial reward, unfortunately, has become equated with worth as a person. However, most of the traditional household roles formerly performed by women exclusively (but now handled by people of both sexes) have never been compensated by the dollar. This poses a problem, since undoubtedly those at-home tasks contribute services to society equally valuable in comparison to marketplace \"jobs\". Therefore, in order for society to fully acknowledge the value of both types of jobs--in the home and outside the home, some sort of compensation should be made for \"home-making service\" as well as for he or she who works outside the home.\nThe career with a capital C is traditionally seen as the route to performing a service to society worth rewarding with a paycheck. Certainly doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs contribute invaluable resources to human civilization and deserve to be compensated for their labors. Teachers, engineers, artists, politicians and all those who enrich our lives and our cultures, and on whom we depend, are indispensable to society. Whether they be male or female has no bearing on the size of their reward; \"equal pay for equal work\" is a well-worded and time-honored phrase.\nBut what is \"equal work\"? It is fairly easy to establish equity between marketplace jobs with duties and responsibilities that are roughly similar. That is, a teacher of sophomore high school English and a teacher of senior high school English perform comparable tasks and therefore should be equally compensated. But how do we compare raising a family of four children over a period of twenty-five years to the job of an neurosurgeon over the same period of time? I know of no culture on this globe that pays a woman (or a man, for that matter) a yearly salary of $50,000 for nurturing and educating children from the cradle to near-dependence. And yet this contribution to society in so immense as to be practically immeasurable. In fact, many of the ills of society in the U.S. today have been traced by study after study to the lack of firm guidance and support from the family.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In \"first-world\" cultures around the globe, the value of a human being has become increasingly equated with the dollars he or she generates in the marketplace\u2014specifically, through the job one performs for monetary compensation. Unfortunately, the amount of this financial reward has come to define worth as a person. While this view holds, most traditional household roles once performed exclusively by women\u2014now shared by both sexes\u2014have never been compensated in monetary terms. This discrepancy poses a significant problem, as these at-home tasks contribute equally valuable services to society. Therefore, in order for society to fully acknowledge the value of both types of jobs\u2014those in the home and those outside\u2014it is necessary to provide some form of compensation for \"home-making services\" alongside those performed outside the home.\n\nThe traditional career path, with its emphasis on financial reward, is often seen as the primary route to contributing to society's well-being and deserving compensation. Doctors, lawyers, and Indian chiefs, among others, undoubtedly contribute invaluable resources to human civilization and warrant compensation for their labors. Teachers, engineers, artists, politicians, and all those who enrich our lives and our cultures are indispensable to society. Whether they are male or female, \"equal pay for equal work\" is a well-established principle.\n\nHowever, the concept of \"equal work\" becomes more complex when we consider the value of domestic labor. It is relatively straightforward to establish equity between marketplace jobs with similar duties and responsibilities. For instance, a teacher of sophomore high school English and a teacher of senior high school English perform comparable tasks and should thus be equally compensated. Yet, how do we measure and compensate the immense contribution of nurturing and educating a family of four children for twenty-five years? In many cultures, no woman\u2014or man\u2014is paid a yearly salary of $50,000 for this vital role. This contribution is not only immense but also practically immeasurable. Numerous studies have linked the lack of firm guidance and support from the family to many of the societal ills currently faced in the U.S.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

It would seem to follow that if indeed money inspired and cultivated evil there would be a negative correlation between money earned and virtue obtained. Perhaps, one might say, that the \"desire\" for money could be gauged in comparison to evil acts committed, but the wealthy would be immediately privelaged in such a formula. Desire cannot be measured on some utilitarian scale of pleasure. It increases and decreases with the acruement of wealth. The wealthy in fact could be more gluttonous than the poor who would seem to have a greater desire for financial gain. I contend that the saying is meaningless-or a least impractical - for summing up the woes and corruption of humanity since desire-much less evil- cannot be appropriated objectively and wheighed against financial aptitude. \n\n\"Happiness\" as a psychological idea can be shown to exist (in as much as \"happiness\" can be defined) among all classes, wealthy and poor. Usually those who fit the term are financially stable and so there is reason to suspect a general trend towards virtue in affluent households if happiness (as I would define it) can also be viewed as a lack of desire for further money, a contentedness with all that one has. What if not that is happiness?\n\nThe problem, however, becomes immediately clear. The desire for money would-must- coincide and flourish with a desire for virtue if virtue, here defined as the counterpart of \"happiness\", is to thrive. Only the serrendipitously rich, the heirs of fortunes, could be the do-gooders of a world where in which money was the \"root of all evil\". As stated, the problem is how these two desires are to be reconciled, called \"compatible\" since, as the saying seems to imply, they are mutually exclusive. \n\n<*>. A truer statement, I think, which illustrates one of the lessons of history: those with power, those with wealth, those who could be our saints are just as often the oppressors as saviors. It is not subtle argument, but the unfolding of history that makes desire such an elusive - and money such a fallible - measuring stick of such an awesome mystery as evil.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "If money was the root of all evil, the poor would be saints.

If a person gains $100 in a jewelry store theft, yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away, cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $50 in medical bills, and spends another $50 for a hideout hotel room, then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole. \nHowever, the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of \"pay\" than simple dollars and cents accounting. In terms of criminal work, pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manners of loss that occur as a result.\nOne issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above. Crime, like any small business, requires an investment. One investment is time. If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify that time expenditure, then the crime has not paid. Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field. If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job, then crimes can earn less to justify time spent. If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions, then his crimes must earn more.\nOther capital investments in crime could include equiptment such as get-away cars, dynamite, weaponry, and disguises. Mafia and police pay-offs could be involved. Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting monies earned with other involved parties. A crime's income must be enough to cover all these expenditures.\nAnother type of loss to be considered is loss of mental or physical health and well being. Many times violence is a part of crime. The cost of taking a gunshot or knife in the leg is more than just the medical bills. It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again. Very few criminals have worker's compensation. The stress that comes about from constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself, and could lessen both a person's life span and enjoyment of life.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "To determine whether or not crime pays, one should first define what is meant by the term \"pays.\" If a person gains $100 from a jewelry store theft but spends ten dollars on gas, incurs $50 in medical bills for a cut from a broken window, and pays another $50 for a hideout hotel room, their crime leaves them ten dollars in the red.

If one has preconceived notions concerning one's salary, one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others. \"Contribution to society\" is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate \"equally'.\nIn the 1920s in American, it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living, but merely lived off the interest of their investments. The stock market was experiencing a boom, and several formerly working-class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early. But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites; they received money, but they contributed nearly nothing to society.\nPeople who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill, some sort of excitement that money cannot buy. Having almost unlimited wealth changes people, both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on. But do they have the right to live this way? What about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably. A migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch.\nThe answer this question lies in one's feelings about Democracry. Some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement (or for their children's inheritance) he or she is entitled to it. A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault (or bad luck).

The guilty are punished, and no one profits. However, that is not always true in the real world. There are many persons who engage in criminal activity to their advantage. In fact one needs only to consider the historical context, the current material gain, and even the consequences of crime in America to prove that crime can be a profitable profession.\nThroughout history crime is a recurrent theme, often praised as the years pass and events become more distant. Consider the vents shaping America's early history: the people involved in the Boston Tea Party were certainly breaking the law when they dumped private property into the harbor, yet this crime became a rallying cry for the American Revolution. Even Benedict Arnold's actions were considered criminal only because of the date on which they occurred. In more recent history, criminals have often become celebrities and profited after they were formally accused -- Divine Brown, Oliver North, and Joey Buttafuco are a few examples of this National Enquirer brand of fame. Likewise, events which reside in the darker portions of this country's history have often brought profit to those committing illegal activities. Prohibition provided income to thousands of people who broke the law daily while running speak-eases or transporting liquor across the border. Of course one cannot forget that the city of Los Vegas was founded  on ill-gotten gains. It seems that those who say that crime does not pay have not read their history books recently.\nThe most obvious reward in committing a crime is the monetary rewards gained from the illegal activities. No one can argue that crime is not a means of making money, if it were not why would people commit them. Yet in America we see those who are found guilty of crimes profiting from them, where but in the \"land of opportunity\" could a person find convicted killers autobiographies on the best-seller list or highlighted as a movie of the week. Not only do the criminals profit (even if they do have to wait until after they are released from prison), but so do the publishers, networks, and advertisers. Apparently crime can be quite profitable if one has the right agent.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Any upstanding citizen will avow that crime does not pay.

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims. I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true, but now many employers are the victims. They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I agree that in the past, women faced significant societal challenges in both the workplace and at home. They were often looked down upon for attempting to advance, and salaries for identical jobs often differed between men and women. However, the age where women were strictly confined to domestic roles is long gone. Today, many women work because they choose to, while others opt to stay home based on personal preference. Much of this transformation can be attributed to feminist movements, which have historically advocated for women's rights and challenged traditional gender roles.\n\nWhile feminist groups have been instrumental in highlighting the capabilities of women in the workplace, their approach has sometimes been overly homogenizing. Not all women share the same desires or expectations. Some were content with established traditions, while others sought more independence and equality. The issue arises when feminist rules and expectations are imposed on all women, regardless of their individual aspirations. This creates a dilemma, as those who deviate from these guidelines risk being ostracized by their peers.\n\nFor example, during the Iraq War, military women sought the opportunity to serve in combat positions. Feminist groups vehemently argued for this change, asserting that women should have the same opportunities as men. While I understand the sentiment, I believe that the physical and psychological demands of combat are best met by those with the necessary strength and resilience. Women can indeed be strong and capable, but the unique risks and demands of such roles should not be taken lightly.\n\nOn the other hand, many women appreciate the current rules that preserve the distinctions between combat and non-combat roles. They see these rules as necessary for maintaining the effectiveness of the military and ensuring the safety of their fellow soldiers.\n\nIn addition to military service, feminist movements have also addressed issues of workplace promotion and sexual harassment. While there is no denying that gender-based discrimination and harassment have been significant problems in the past, the situation has improved in recent years. Many employers today are more proactive in addressing these issues, and women are increasingly empowered to speak out and seek justice. However, it is also important to recognize that women in positions of authority can sometimes contribute to an environment of distrust and bias. Employers must continue to foster a fair and inclusive workplace culture to ensure that both men and women are respected and valued.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

Why? Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter. With this attitude someone could definitely headed for destruction. Its's like when you are a small child trying to see just how much your parents will let you get away with before they discipline you. For an individual that starts out doing small crimes (or less serious crimes that do not harm or endanger the life of another indivudual or a group of people) each time that they are not caught, that just makes them want to try just one more thing that they feel that they may just slide with, and the cycle goes on and on. Once you reach this stage you can consider yourself a habitual offender or someone that needs some kind of jail sentence, punishment or some type of deterent to stop you if not slow you down.\nBesides the fact that you will eventually get caught doing a crime your punishment varies according to the type of crime or crimes that the individual has committed. For example you can expect to get a stiffer punishment for a crime whrn you have endangered someone's life or their personal safety in some way. For those of us who have consciences (especially me having a \"weakness\" for children) would never ever dream of committing crime that may endanger another individual's well-being.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I am a true believer in the old saying that crime does not pay. This belief is rooted in the understanding that whatever actions we take in the dark will eventually come to light. A person who commits a crime might initially reap financial benefits, such as if I robbed a bank and walked away with a cool million. Initially, the individual might feel a surge of financial stability and might even be tempted to engage in more complex, or even more dangerous, activities. With this mindset, one is undoubtedly on a path to self-destruction. It's reminiscent of a small child testing boundaries to gauge how much they can get away with before facing consequences. \n\nFor those beginning with minor infractions, or less serious crimes that do not harm or endanger others, each uncaught offense can fuel the desire to push further. This cycle continues, and once an individual reaches a point where they are repeatedly evading justice, they often become habitual offenders or need some form of deterrent, whether it's a jail sentence, punishment, or a form of retribution to halt their criminal behavior.\n\nBeyond the certainty of eventual capture, the severity of the punishment also varies according to the nature of the crime. For instance, crimes that endanger someone's life or personal safety typically carry more severe penalties. Those of us with consciences\u2014especially those who, like myself, have a \"weakness\" for children\u2014would never contemplate crimes that could harm another's well-being.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

The key is in the definition of term money; money, or whatever a group uses as a means of barter to obtain resources, represents power. Enough money gives you the power to get whatever you need to survive, lack of money may mean you can't survive. But the \"power\" money holds encompasses more than the ability to simply provide sustenance for life. The power of having money means social status, acceptance, prestige--a place in society--can be bought also. These results of having money sound like positive benefits, and in fact may be. But there is another side to possessing money.\n\nMoney of itself is neither good nor bad. Ones's attitude about money is the deciding factor that determines what influence money has. It can be an influence for evil if the need for whatever it buys is possessing the buyer--whether that is a physical or an emotional need. The list of addictions people develop are endless; drug use, gambling and prostitution are obvious problems, but there are others more subtle. The need for material possessions can be an addictive force behind one's need for money. The need for social prestige and the privilege that comes with it can be a force driving one to want more and more money. when the need for money becomes the driving force, some people will use whatever means it takes to get it--evil or not.\n\nWanting more and more, never being satisfied, can also be termed greed. Greedy people usually have one objective; to get what they want regardless of the consequences. Values and ethics play very little importance in structure of a greedy persons life and money is just a tool to gain what is needed. Money does good or evil--depending on who has the money\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Money is an ancient concept that has echoed through the ages as \"the root of all evil.\" This saying underscores a fundamental truth: the power that money represents is not inherently good or bad. The true essence of money lies in its ability to serve as a means of barter and to provide for survival. However, the power it grants goes beyond mere sustenance, extending to social status, acceptance, and prestige. These factors can indeed bring positive benefits, but they can also have darker consequences.\n\nMoney itself is neutral; it is one's attitude toward it that determines its influence. When the desire for money becomes driven by a need\u2014whether physical, emotional, or social\u2014the potential for misuse becomes significant. Just as people can become addicted to substances like drugs, gambling, or prostitution, the pursuit of material possessions can also develop into a compulsive behavior. Similarly, the craving for social prestige and the privileges that come with it can become an insatiable quest for more money.\n\nIn such cases, the need for money can escalate to a form of greed. Greedy individuals often prioritize their goals over ethical considerations, viewing money as a tool to achieve their desires without regard for the consequences. Their values and ethics take a backseat to their relentless pursuit of wealth. Thus, while money can do good when used responsibly, it can also be a vehicle for evil when the desire for it becomes a dominant force in one's life.\n\nUltimately, the influence of money is shaped by the individual's mindset and intentions. It is a powerful tool that can lead to positive outcomes when used to meet genuine needs and support well-being. However, when it is pursued with an overwhelming and unyielding desire, it can become a source of corruption and moral decay. Therefore, it is essential to approach money with a balanced and ethical perspective to ensure it serves its intended purpose of enhancing life rather than diminishing it.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touch their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the \"I'd rather do it myself\" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, whether you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitude of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.\nNow, after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to be in the 60's, and not looking down on females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home. \nNowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and take care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent with each other).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I have been around this continent for over 40 years, and while I support some of the causes women are promoting, I strongly disagree with much of it.

It contains a common truth that is to often overlooked: in the world crime actually costs money. As we read the daily paper, listen to the evening news or speak to other people we hear stories of how crime has robbed individuals of possessions, jobs and lives.\nThe individual who commits a crime, if and when they are caught will in most cases be faced with the loss of his or her freedom. If the individual is incarcerated whether for one hour or for a lifetime money will be lost on the cost of incarceration. This money may not come from the perpetrator of the crime but it will come from the individual's family, freinds and acquantances in the form of tax dollars. As the number of criminals increases so to will the tax money needed to house these individuals. \nThe moral aspect of crime for the criminal is also something to take into account. For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse and sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom.

I can say that I am truly educated on \"both sides of the track\". \nI have opinions on both aspects of crime. I will begin with the unorganized first and save the best for last. To me, an unorganized criminal must be very good and have considered all aspects of what they are doing in order not to get caught. The types of crimes these individuals commit are things like: robbery, assault, rape, and theft. More or less, these are petty offenses because they do not hold a high dollar value. These people are usually somewhat less educated and believe what they do is essential for survival. I cannot comment on whether there is a valid reason for committing a crime or not, but I do know that life for some people is very difficult and unless someone can really feel and understand what others go through, they have no room to judge. This type of crime very rarely pays, because the criminals just are not that good. People tell others what they did and soon the word is out. There are - in many cases - witnesses to the acts. Aside from those, these criminals just do not have the money.

I cannot judge the validity of their reasons for committing crimes, as I recognize that life can be extremely challenging for some people. Without truly feeling and understanding what others go through, there is no basis for judgment. Unorganized criminals rarely profit from their crimes because they are often not skilled enough to operate effectively. Their schemes are often uncovered by others who know what has transpired, and there are frequently witnesses to their acts.

What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history of the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity. Nowadays, both \"feminist\" and \"feminism\" are dirty words because the cause has been misused by people who want women to be dominant rather than equal.\nSusan B. Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment in society. The ideas behind \"feminism\" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights to the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life. Rather, the more people that feel comfortable that they have a say in how their life turns out, or is lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.\nThe concept many people today have of a \"feminist\" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. But, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout at the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism then they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the dominant gender and all men should adhere to their wishes and call it feminism then they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for the radical women to get angry under, to shout from and to feel safe within. Outsiders now see the feminist movement as a bunch of whining women, who don't want equality but want dominance.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The only reason this statement exists is because of the misuse of the original term \"feminist.\" Historically, women banded together for recognition and equality, not exclusivity. However, today, both \"feminist\" and \"feminism\" are seen negatively due to how the cause has been twisted by individuals who advocate for women's dominance over equality.\n\nSusan B. Anthony originally led the feminist movement because she believed women should receive equal treatment in society. The foundational ideals of feminism were rooted in the belief that all humans\u2014men and women\u2014should be treated as equals, free to make choices about their lives without undue discrimination. Historically, men held exclusive rights to vote, employment opportunities, and other societal perks that empowered individuals. This does not mean that gaining these rights automatically solves life's complexities. Rather, when more individuals feel they have a say in their lives, society benefits as a whole. People who feel secure in their lives are more likely to interact harmoniously with others, reducing conflict.\n\nToday, many people misconceive a \"feminist\" as a boisterous, lesbian figure who despises men. This is far from the truth. The issue arises because radical women have used the feminist movement as a shield. By labeling their actions as feminism, they can justify their aggressive behavior. If women claim that they should be the dominant gender and men must comply, they can avoid criticism. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a safe space for radical women to express anger, assert dominance, and avoid accountability. As a result, outsiders now view feminism as a group of whiny women who seek dominance rather than equality.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences. This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary. This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.\nSince its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion. Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were noticed and ridiculed, thus defeating their cause, because of their aggressive action. At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was therfore, detrimental to the good of society.\nAlthough \"radicals\" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards, the problem still exists. From the very beginning the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle. However, I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement, but rather, in the perception of those observing the movement. \nWhen Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. Immediately, the focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself. Those outside the movement could only see the differences between \"normality\" and Women's Lib.\nThis is still true twenty-five years later. Women supporting equal pay for women and and other \"liberal\" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s. The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals.\nSo what am I getting at? Only that so-called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women's movement.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Whenever a movement is initiated, whether it be political, religious, or artistic, stereotypes are quick to form.

We hear the word \"battle\" used often when we read of the suffragates, those women who sought out their equality, labored for years to gain access to the political system, and finally won the right only after the power structure of American politics (a male-only bastion) heard their battle cries and acknowledged their determination to achieve equal status. No one today would say that women are not equal to men in the voting booths of America.\n\nDoes this \"battle\" continue? Those women who believe in equal opportunity, equal recognition, equal pay, and equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender certainly would say so. Undoubtedly, there are still those among us, both male and female, who resent women who have spoken out. Names like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinam, women who made their mark as feminists of the '60s, are greeted with cheers or jeers from any crowd. The fact remains, however, that they were and continue to be influential in how America reacts and responds to its women. They have always preached the same sermon, from the same pulpit: <*>.Throughout America, a generation of young women, daughters of those women of the '60s now find doors of opportunity open to them which would have slammed in the faces of their mothers and grandmothers. Women's access to law schools, medical schools, college campuses, and corporate board rooms have expanded greatly because of the insistence of these early feminists.

When money is accumulated by these means, it seems incorrect to say that money is the root of all evil. If one is attaining money honestly, how can honestly be associated with evil?\n\nIt is true to say that money is the root of some evil.

These actions are evil and because someone wanted money, or wanted more money than they had, they resorted to evil to attain it.\n\nOther things as well can be the root of evil: attitudes, morals (lack of), greed; there is an endless list of things that can become the root of evil. The love of money can indeed produce an attitude of dishonesty, a lack of morals, and greed.\n\nIf money was the root of all evil, then the many agencies, groups and programs that we have in America and around the world would not be able to function without the donations of money from those who are able to give. I have to agree that many times these worth-while causes are sometimes being used to satisfy an individual's greed; but I am sure that most if not all funds donated are used for the purposes intended in those agencies and programs which are reputable.\n\nIn conclusion, the root of all evil is the choice of the individual: will he choose to be morally decent, or will he choose to be evil?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The first thing I would like to address is the fact that the phrase \"The Love of Money Is the Root of All Evil\" is incorrect.

So if one wants to eat, have some where to sleep, have transportation and clothing, the almighty dollar is a must.\n\nIt's probably more correct to say that, \"Absolute power currupts absolute\". Once ones basic and comfort needs are met, what's next, power or the power to influence. This begats the will for more power and the cicle goes on. Unless the individual has a good work ethic and good sence, the power can become intoxicating to the point of it being the obsession that controls a person's life.\n\nAnything that comes easy most probably won't be as appreciated or valued as something that comes with effort. Money makes things happen, and quickly. If one has to work hard for their salary, they most likely will spend it more wisely than if someone always had plenty of money and never had to work for a living.\n\nThis brings up another theory of how people use money. Some use it to live and others live to use it. Money can be either a slave for us or it can make us slaves. Many people rate the quality of life and sucess by a dollar figure that they made last year. Others rate success one heir more substantive accomplishments that agree with their sense of values, of which money is not number one. The people who rate their success by that dollar figure also must compare and be competitive with others. The person who rates success on substantive accomplishments can stand alone and have self satisfaction.\n\nMoney is something that our society has made indespencable. It is for us to use, not for it to use us. We are to be the masters and use it for our needs and good. It is not to be our master.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "It's challenging to justify the saying \"money is power and power is everything\" in a world where financial resources hold such significant sway. In a society where the barter system is long gone, it's evident that without money, nothing functions. One must have the almighty dollar to secure basic necessities like food, shelter, transportation, and clothing. \n\nYet, it might be more accurate to say, \"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Once these fundamental needs are met, the quest for power and influence often follows. This cycle perpetuates a constant desire for more, which can become intoxicating, leading to its obsession ruling a person's life. Unless an individual possesses a strong work ethic and sound judgment, the allure of power can be overwhelming.\n\nEffort often adds value and appreciation to our possessions and experiences. Money expedites the acquisition of these, but those who earn their salaries through hard work are more likely to manage their finances wisely. Conversely, those who have always been financially secure might not value money as much, and their decisions might be less thoughtful.\n\nThis distinction leads to another theory about the use of money. Some people use it to live, while others live to use it. Money can be both a tool that serves us and a master that enslaves us. Many measure their success by the dollar figure they made the previous year, constantly comparing themselves to others. In contrast, those who focus on substantive accomplishments aligned with their values find success and self-satisfaction without the need for monetary validation.\n\nSociety has made money indispensable, but it's crucial that we remain the masters, using it to fulfill our needs and contribute positively to our lives.

Is money actually evil? Does it cause evil? If someone has money does it make that person evil?\n\nI believe what they are trying to say is, you always want more that you have and the more you have the more you want. You want money, the things money can buy, and the power that goes with having money. This leads you away from the christian way of life and into a life of evil.\n\nA christian has a God centered life. The christian way of life is often thought of as being subservant, living without material things, and always thinking of those less fortunate than you. Having money and power are unimportant to the person who has God as the center of their life.\n\nIf you lead a life that is based on how much money you have, you are always searching for the next dollar you will get and how you will get it. Your family and friends will become unimportant and you can become consumed with obtaining more money. You can be lead into gambling and the life associated with gambling. As your need for more money increases you will do almost anything for it.\n\nMoney is not evil. Money is incapable of being evil since it is a mear piece of paper or coins and can not make judgements and decisions. It is the person whose judgements, decisions, and actions that can be evil.\n\nMoney can be used to lessen the hardships in life. It can purchase homes for the homeless, buy food and clothing for the poor. Money can provide opportunities to educated the uneducated which will enable them to be able to provide a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nIs money the root of all evil? I think not, it is all in how it is used and how you allow it to use you!\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Money is often the subject of debate and discussion, with many people voicing the opinion that it is inherently evil. However, what they are actually suggesting is that the insatiable desire for more money and the pursuit of wealth can lead individuals away from a Christian life centered around God and into a life of greed and evil. This belief stems from the idea that the more money one has, the more one desires, leading away from a God-centered life to one focused on materialism and power.\n\nIn a Christian context, the ideal life is one where God is at the center, and material possessions and wealth are secondary concerns. Christians are expected to live selflessly, prioritize those less fortunate, and refrain from placing undue importance on material wealth. When money becomes the primary focus of an individual's life, their priorities shift, often at the expense of family, friends, and moral integrity. This shift can lead to a life filled with greed, where one is constantly seeking to acquire more, potentially even through unethical means. For instance, the pursuit of money can consume one's life to the point of engaging in activities like gambling, which can spiral out of control.\n\nMoney itself is not evil; it is merely a tool, a means of exchange. It becomes problematic when it becomes the driving force in one's life and when it influences one's moral decisions and actions. Money is incapable of making judgements or decisions; these are actions that stem from the individual's own character and choices. Therefore, the real concern should not be with money, but with the person whose actions and decisions are guided by money rather than moral principles.\n\nMoney can be a force for good, enabling individuals and organizations to alleviate suffering and improve lives. It can fund homes for the homeless, provide food and clothing for the poor, and support education for the underprivileged, which can help them break the cycle of poverty and improve their quality of life. Money, when used responsibly, can contribute positively to society.\n\nIs money the root of all evil? I do not believe so. The true root of evil lies in the actions and intentions of the individual who wields money. How one uses money and how one allows it to influence their life are the critical factors. When used wisely and ethically, money can be a powerful tool for good, but when it becomes the ultimate goal, it can lead to a life of greed and harm.\n\nMoney, in and of itself, is neutral.

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I beg to differ; crime does pay.

Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs. Being that its a very sensitive, horrifying, and contraversal issue, its one of the less publically broadcast problem in society today. Suicide gets most of its attention only when its a well known public figure. Suicide used to be just an adult problem, but over the years suicide has decreased for all groups of people except young people <R>. Before 1960, there wasn't much literature about adolescent suicide, but after an epidemic of suicide clusters in the on-coming years and a steady rise in adolescent suicide, the media and researchers took notice <R>. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for the ages 15 through 24 jumped from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000 <R>. And in 1987, the age range of 15 through 19 rates were 10.3 alone <R>. Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>. In general, white males are the leading suicidal victims over any other race or gender, but adolescent suicide is still a major social problem for all races and genders, specifically black males and black and white females <*> <R>.\n\tDuring the years of this rise in adolescent suicide, there have been many works and studies done on this issue of adolescent suicide. These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening. There have also been many case studies done on individuals looking for the cause and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different way at looking at this problem and see the causes is to look at the problem theoretically.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When one thinks of the worst problem facing young people today, drug abuse and crime often come to mind. However, arguably, the most pressing issue is adolescent suicide. This problem, though garnering less attention than other societal issues like guns and drugs, is a major concern in our society. Given its sensitive and controversial nature, adolescent suicide is one of the least publicized issues in contemporary society. While it was primarily associated with adults, over the years, suicide rates for young people have increased significantly. Before 1960, there was limited literature on adolescent suicide. However, following a series of suicide clusters and a steady rise in adolescent suicide rates, both the media and researchers began to take notice. From 1959 to 1982, the suicide rate for ages 15 to 24 rose from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000. In 1987, the rate for ages 15 to 19 stood at 10.3 per 100,000. Despite the dramatic rise in suicides, the number of suicide attempts among adolescents has been even more alarming. Between 1964 and 1984, the suicide attempt rate for those under 19 increased from 50:1 to 312:1. While white males have historically been the leading victims of suicide, adolescent suicide is a critical social problem for all races and genders, with particular attention needed for black males and black and white females.\n\nDuring this period of increasing adolescent suicide, numerous works and studies have been conducted to address this issue. Researchers have approached the topic from various angles, analyzing statistical data as well as focusing on preventive measures and early detection strategies. Case studies have also been conducted to explore the causes and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different perspective is to analyze the issue theoretically.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

Food and shelter are fundamental needs a person must have in order to survive. A percentage of the population of the citizens of America lack these necessities. Homelessness has become an intense problem in the United States that must be solved. There is an agreement between all opposing viewpoints in government that something must be done that to combat homelessness. The necessary method to be used to understand homelessness is under careful scrutiny. Advocates for people without homes tend to get so wrapped up in the size of the homeless population that they ignore the fact that it is not right that this discrepancy exists. What is true is that in the United States it is continually growing, and action must be taken immediately to alleviate the problem.\n      People living without shelter has been a problem in America since settlers from Europe came. Coming to America meant freedom and opportunity to the early settlers. They arrived in masses to the coast penniless and with no shelter. Throughout history this trend has continued. During the 19th century, industry in this country rose to new heights. Numerous factories developed, in these factories the workers had a great insecurity about their job permanence. Unemployment became a live threat to most working Americans. Impoverished people were interpreted negatively as seen in the book Homelessness: A Sourcebook by Rick Fantasia and Maurice Isserman which states that <*>. Cheap labor was a direct result of trying to distinguish between the homeless that deserved help and the ones that did not. The cheap labor was used in industry and it provided the authorities with an excuse to limit the funds that had been designated for the poor.\n      During the middle of the 19th century there was an increased desire to help the homeless. In this movement poorhouses were established. As  with the cheap labor, poorhouses were only available to the people that were the most \"deserving\" of the poor. This attempt did not help prevent homelessness. The establishement of poorhouses only separated the general public from the people without homes to a greater extent. Tramps were part of the homeless community living in the poorhouses. There was also an increase in migratory workers during this time.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "A basic right of a human being living in a democratic society is the entitlement to life, which necessitates fundamental needs such as food and shelter.

Advocates for the homeless often focus on the magnitude of the problem, yet overlook the fact that the very existence of homelessness is unjust and must be rectified.\n\nHomelessness in America has been a persistent issue since the arrival of European settlers. These early settlers viewed America as a land of freedom and opportunity, often arriving penniless and without shelter. Throughout history, this trend has continued. In the 19th century, the rise of industry led to significant changes. Factories proliferated, and workers faced great job insecurity, making unemployment a constant threat. This period also saw the negative interpretation of impoverished individuals, as evidenced in Rick Fantasia and Maurice Isserman\u2019s book, *Homelessness: A Sourcebook*, which highlights the view that the homeless were often seen as not deserving assistance. The pursuit of cheap labor emerged as a direct result of this attitude, which allowed authorities to limit funds allocated for the poor by distinguishing between those who were \"deserving\" and \"undeserving.\"\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, there was a growing desire to address homelessness, leading to the establishment of poorhouses. Similar to cheap labor, these poorhouses were also selective, only offering assistance to those deemed most \"deserving\" of the poor. This approach did little to prevent homelessness; instead, it further entrenched the division between the general public and the homeless. Additionally, tramps, part of the homeless community, were among those housed in poorhouses. This period also saw an increase in migratory workers, who faced similar challenges and contributed to the growing problem of homelessness.\n\nThis historical context underscores the ongoing struggle to address homelessness effectively. The establishment of poorhouses and the concept of cheap labor both highlight the societal attitudes and policies that have contributed to the persistence of homelessness, making it imperative that we reevaluate our approach to this critical issue.", "speed": 0.45738549940402057, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

With over fourteen million people reliant on welfare in the United States, some change is definitely needed. Conservatives hope to abolish the system completely while liberals insist that welfare reform is the answer. Nevertheless, a crucial question must first be answered: Why does welfare exist?\n      Public welfare was first provided to families under the Social Security Act of 1935 as Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) . The target group was children who had become economically dependent because of the deaths of their fathers. The theory behind the act was that the number of families headed by women, who were primarily widows at that time, would remain small and that these mothers should remain at home rather than trying to achieve economic independence in the labor market.\n      However, by 1962, welfare rolls had expanded. Children were no longer found to be dependent just because of the deaths of their fathers but also because the fathers had left the family or had never been part of the family unit. The program name was also changed to Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) <R>.\n      In 1967, the Work Incentive Program (WIN) was established to provide job training and counseling services. These services recognized that welfare families had special social and psychological difficulties. Child-care efforts were also expanded. Plus, \"job developers\" were attached to WIN offices to locate appropriate positions for WIN graduates.\n      Further reforms occurred in 1971. Under the Talmadge Amendments, WIN offices were required to spend at least one-third of their funds for on-the-job training or public-service employment. The new theory was that placement in these components would improve the chances of participants obtaining regular jobs at the end of their assignments. It was also believed that welfare recipients lacked motivation to enter the work force and needed to be pushed into it <R>.\n      Nevertheless, none of the past or present reforms of welfare policy have succeeded in lowering the number of welfare recipients in the United States.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories;  accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc.  The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.  The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster.  Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.\nThe mental effect of computers is two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, etc. People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.  What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.  Granted, it is the person who \"told\" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated \"was able to do with a computer\", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict.  Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many \"variables\".\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people.  A computer's circuits don't get tired and, if programmed 100% correctly (another perhaps impossible computation), never make errors.  This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work.  The effects of this are unpredictable.  Anger, frustration, fear, and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The modern microcomputer (PC) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace, transforming from the first modern computer in the 1940s to the sophisticated devices we use today.

While the computer has automated many jobs, leading to the elimination of manual labor in factories and the simplification of tasks in fields like accounting and engineering, the phenomenon presents a paradox. The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint but harder from a mental one.\n\nFrom an observable perspective, the physical effects of the computer are numerous and evident. In offices, computers have revolutionized productivity through word processors, spreadsheet programs, and database management systems. Automation in factories has also significantly reduced the need for manual labor. Even in everyday life, nearly everyone owns at least a simple computer, such as a calculator, and these devices are used for a myriad of purposes. It is unnecessary to list all the applications, as most people are already aware of the ubiquity of computers, with the notable exception of individuals in some second and third-world countries.\n\nThe mental effects of computers are two-fold. Firstly, while computers have made mathematical computations remarkably easy, they have also led to a decline in understanding of basic principles. Many people rely on computers to perform complex calculations without fully grasping the underlying processes. This reliance can result in a surplus of \"needless\" computations and figures, as people often do not realize that computers can make errors, which are ultimately due to human input. Mathematical models, theories, and other computations are frequently riddled with errors because humans often lack the knowledge or ability to predict certain variables. Consequently, the prevalence of these errors is a direct reflection of human ignorance.\n\nSecondly, computers have sometimes surpassed human reliability, particularly in scenarios where human error can be costly or dangerous. A computer's circuits do not get tired and, if programmed correctly, never make mistakes\u2014though achieving perfect programming is itself a challenging task. This supposed reliability has led to the displacement of numerous workers, causing a range of negative emotions such as anger, frustration, and fear.

This, realistically, has been quite a new invention, and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly. Not to mention how it will change people's life styles in the future. These changes resulting from the invention of the computer, have been, I feel both bad and good.\n\tTechnologically, computers have improved people's lives drastically. No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually, or even with a simple typewriter. Personal computers are becoming quite common, and therefore less expensive and easier to own. Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before. Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open. We now have ATM, automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do. It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers! We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently. Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results.\n\tWhile computers have brought about improvements, in my opinion, they also have \"impersonalized\" the world. Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \"fast enough\". Interraction with humans in some places is extinct. Yes, it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank, but I miss the human interraction between people. In addition, it is also very dangerous to place all of one's trust in a  machine. It is a common fact machines do fail! Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires. Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions, and therefore are incapable, in some instances to function. With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future. Some of these changes will save people's lives, such as advances in medical technology, safety, etc.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I feel that the invention of the computer has significantly changed people's lives.

I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual.  Every individual holds a different perspective of life and what they consider to be valuable and important. I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice & discrimination as my topic, because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace.\n\tCultural and racial equality is a new term that as a society we are striving for.  People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today's society.  As individuals we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminitive media language and advertising. In the past this type of discrimination, which includes more then blacks African Americans, but also other ethnicities and women, has been excepted as a way of life. Few individuals have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes, and inequality, and demand freedom and equality.  Numerous hidden talents, strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society.  However, today we are beginning to move in a new direction.  People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be unlearned. Together as a society, and as a much larger world we are recognizing the value in learning from difference. Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed but rather they are being celebrated. Organizations and forms are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism.\n\tThe opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up, the avalibility to study cultural difference and reflect the knowledge on ourselves is improving. Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existance of all humanity.

Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered.

Clearly, of the inventions of this century, the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television. This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room, making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible. However, the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time;  one has only to turn it on to tune out reality.\n\tTelevision has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers, such as educational programming for children, cultural programs about far away places, and a closer look at current events than cannot be given by newspaper. Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production, giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully. However, this is not the way in which television has influenced society. On the contrary, television has become the escape route of the masses, a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture, rather than confront them and try to understand them. \n\tIn the minds of most Americans, television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool, as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge. Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time, watching sit-coms, soap-operas, and cartoons. The T.V. has become the center of many households; in many families, the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television. T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families,  and has also resulted in an increase in laziness. The more time one spends watching TV, the less motivated he becomes; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch, pick up the remote control, and stare at a box.\n\tTelevision, therefore, has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago.

The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease.

It not only changed the lives of countless individuals but also served as a foundation for subsequent medical advancements.\n\nFor individuals born in the latter half of the 20th century, polio has never been a concern, as it is one of the many vaccines administered during childhood. In contrast, for some of our parents and grandparents, the dread of polio was a constant fear. The polio vaccine was first widely implemented in the mid-20th century, particularly during the Baby Boom era. As a result, fewer children suffered from the disease, and had a greater chance of a healthy childhood. This had a significant effect on the population as a whole, and while it is uncertain whether the vaccine directly caused the Baby Boom, it undoubtedly contributed to a larger and more resilient population.\n\nThe polio vaccine not only saved lives but also opened new avenues for medical innovation. It demonstrated that it was possible to protect against deadly diseases through vaccination, even by introducing a weakened form of the virus to stimulate immunity. Thanks to Dr. Salk, we are more protected than we would have been in a world filled with uncertainty. The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for other medical breakthroughs, showing that humanity could overcome some of the most fearsome diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, the polio vaccine was more than just a medical triumph; it was a milestone in the history of public health. It not only saved countless lives and changed the lives of entire generations but also laid the groundwork for future medical advancements, making our world a safer place.", "speed": 0.4650894620718598, "eta": "00h08m03s"}

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too. Unfortunately, wars have used airplanes. Japan bombing Pearl Habor, for example, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The invention of the airplane, in my opinion, has drastically changed the lives of many people.

Without the airplane, my trip from the U.S. to Spain would have taken an extraordinary amount of time\u2014perhaps a week. This innovation has extended its influence beyond mere vacation travel, affecting various other areas, including business, entertainment, and intercontinental relations.\n\nFirstly, the impact of the airplane on travel is undeniable. Travel times have been significantly shortened; for example, driving from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, whereas flying the same distance takes only about 3 hours. This reduction in travel time allows people greater flexibility in their travel plans, enabling them to spend more quality time at their chosen destination rather than merely traveling.\n\nMoreover, the business world has flourished due to the airplane. The greatly decreased travel times have facilitated easier and more frequent international business collaborations. Today, it is relatively easy for American businesspeople to establish and maintain relationships in any part of the world. This improvement has led to a significant increase in international business during the past few decades. For instance, business executives can now easily travel to and from different countries, fostering global partnerships and cooperation.\n\nThe entertainment industry has also benefited from the invention of the airplane. Entertainers, whether musicians, actors, or athletes, can now travel more quickly to diverse locations. For example, Michael Jackson\u2019s recent concert in Madrid would have been much more challenging to organize without air transportation. Moreover, professional athletic teams can reduce travel time and play more games in various places, enhancing the global reach of sports.\n\nLastly, the invention of the airplane has had a mixed impact on intercontinental relations. On the positive side, air transportation has facilitated essential activities such as peace talks between nations. These would be much less frequent if leaders required a week to travel to international meetings. Additionally, heads of state can more easily interact with each other in their respective countries, thanks to air transportation. However, the negative aspects are also significant. Wars, unfortunately, have utilized airplanes, such as Japan\u2019s bombing of Pearl Harbor and the U.S. dropping of atomic bombs on Japan. Despite these darker aspects, the overall impact of the airplane on global communication", "speed": 0.4650894620718598, "eta": "00h08m03s"}

Though advances in communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk.  In the second of the world wars, the race was on to create the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known.  In my opinion, the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime, if not, perhaps, in several lifetimes.\n\tAs missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved, fear began to replace nationalism, and our small world erected barriers between its members.  From my experience as an American, I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat, Soviet citizens with anti-Christ, and bomb shelters, secret cities for underground, and weapons orbiting our planet, with daily, normal life.  Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear, cold war age.  In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues, my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing, improvement, and implementation.  As a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations, the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air.\n\tIn just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom, and an end to oppression in many circumstances.  With this, the walls, barbed wire, and mental barriers are falling, bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis.  Although the old habits die hard, they are indeed dying.

As a natural antibiotic, penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections.  This \"wonder-drug\" also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally-occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured \"in vitro\" in a laboratory.  This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered.\n\tAs discoveries of new antibiotics decreased, chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine.  It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis.  Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research, more companies, and more medical chemists, and the industry increased tremendously.  It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active.  New drugs were also synthesized; some were found to be medically useful while others were not.  A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine.  It was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses, such as the common cold.  Huge enterprises, such as Upjohn, were formed and grew, and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics.\n\tThe discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people, to the discovery of more and more antibiotics, and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies.

Sandwiches, crackers, cookies, cereal, etc. do not get stale as quickly when they are stored in these bags (without any air). Food also stays fresh in the freezer. Anything can be put in zip-lock bag, and not get freezer burn.\n\tAnother thing that zip-lock bags are good for is keeping certain odors in the bags and certain odors out. I cannot even count the number of times that my father would pack a roast beef sandwich to bring to school to lunch,  and by the time lunch came around, I could smell the sandwich before I even opened my locker. . Finally, I asked him to put my sandwich in a zip-lock bag, and I never had a smelly locker again.\n\tThere are also times when foods tend to take on the smells of other foods to which they are near. One solution would be to put the odorous food in a bag, but if that cannot be done for some reason (for example, you are going to serve it for a fancy dinner later), you can put the surrounding food in the bag, to keep the smell out. A third solution would be to bag everything!\n\tBut, there are other uses for zip-lock bags. Where else can you put ice to hold on a swelling lip, without it melting and getting everything wet? And for traveling, these baggies are even better. Too many times people have opened suitcases at the end of a long day, only to find shampoo all over their \"dry-clean only's\" (onlies???)

However, when I asked for the sandwich to be placed in a zip-lock bag, I never again had to deal with a smelly locker. These bags also help in preventing certain foods from absorbing the smells of others. For instance, if you cannot transfer the odorous food into a bag, you can place the surrounding food in one to keep the undesirable scent at bay. In extreme cases, you can even bag everything to maintain a fresh environment.\n\nBeyond these practical uses, zip-lock bags have many other applications. For instance, they are ideal for holding ice to treat swelling, as they prevent the ice from melting and damaging surrounding items. Additionally, when traveling, these bags are indispensable. They protect clothing from spills and messes. For example, after a long day, one might open their suitcase and find shampoo all over \"dry-clean only\" items.

This invention of the late 20th century has forever changed the way people live and work.  \n\tThe first computers were expensive monsters that filled an entire room and could perform only a few calculations a second.  With the advancement in technology and the move toward miniaturization, the desktop PC has evolved.  These small, relatively inexpensive machines can do everything their  predecessors did and much more.  Every day new and exciting improvements are being made to enhance the performance of these tools.\n\tThe impact of computers on the world has been great.  They have changed the way people do business and have radically altered the way data and information is dealt with. In short, the productivity of people has increased ten-fold. As we move into the 2st century this fact will become more important.  The amount of information that is available in the world will require the use of computers to organize and extract that which is of interest.  The personal computer has, and will continue to play a major role in our lives.

Provide only the final essay.\n\nOne of the most important discoveries of the 20th Century would have to be AIDS.  This discovery of AIDS has changed how people think, live, and view mortality.  At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.  AIDS victims should be accepted & given the respect that they deserve.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "One of the most important discoveries of the 20th Century would undoubtedly be the identification and understanding of AIDS. This discovery has profoundly altered how people think, live, and view mortality. Initially, AIDS was perceived as a predominantly homosexual disease. The lack of tolerance for homosexuality in the early 80s meant that many did not care about the high mortality rates among gay men. However, as it became evident that intravenous drug users were also at risk, the indifference shifted, but only because there was a false belief that AIDS would not impact them personally.\n\nIt was not until children began to be infected with AIDS that society truly began to care. The thought of a young, innocent child suffering from such a horrific disease was almost inconceivable. By the end of the 80s, there was a growing awareness of AIDS, but this awareness was accompanied by a wave of discrimination. \n\nOne of the key figures in the public discourse on AIDS was Ryan White, a twelve-year-old hemophiliac. His case brought the disease into the spotlight, leading to a nationwide panic that their children could contract AIDS by merely being in his presence. This fear catalyzed a public campaign to educate people about the transmission of AIDS. Everywhere, from television and magazines to radio and schools, there was information about how to prevent the disease. Despite this increased knowledge, many parents continued to resist the distribution of condoms in schools, preferring to promote abstinence. While abstinence is a safer approach, it is unrealistic to expect children to abstain from all sexual activity, especially given that many children are sexually active by the age of eleven. As a result, the stigma surrounding AIDS has diminished, and it is now more accepted as a reality.\n\nDue to the discovery and the spread of AIDS, society has become acutely aware that promiscuity and unsafe sex can lead to death. This realization has prompted increased efforts to both find a cure and to accept and respect those living with AIDS. At present, more urgent than a cure is the need to educate the public and to accept and support AIDS victims. It is regrettable that the public's attention was only drawn to AIDS through the involvement of a public figure like Magic Johnson, a basketball superstar who contracted the disease. Even without a cure, the acceptance and respect of AIDS victims should be a priority.\n\nIn conclusion,", "speed": 0.4650894620718598, "eta": "00h08m03s"}

We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology, and using it to dominate nature, as well as our fellow man.  Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities.  We attempt to  dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death, and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without our petty insecurities.  For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people's lives for the better are those that have occured in the medical field.  Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death, they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do.  They save lives.\n\tBy closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions, one notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature.   We are ourselves a part of nature, yet we attempt to live outside of it.  We continue to destroy the plants, animals, and the earth itself  and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways.  Therefore, inventions in the 0the century have had, for the most part, a negative affect on our lives because by destroying nature, we're destroying ourselves.\n\tIn addition, our inventions are used to dominate one another.

What the PC (personal computer) meant for society was an affordable tool that would help one sort out, save, delete or add and receive information in one's own home. This made it possible to write papers, look over databases, do your taxes and expense accounts, just about anything that you had to do. It was a way to organize your work and the information that you had to process in an easier fashion and much more quickly. Since 1980 there have been many advances in the technology that was first made available because of this machine.

Each decade in itself has introduced a new \"fad\" or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as \"typical\" of the era. The \"Roaring 20's\" for example was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile. A very capricious decade, it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the \"Great Depression\" of the 30's. How could we ever forget the \"Fabulous Fifties\" or the hippie decade of the 60's and 70's? For change is inevitable, and as difficult as it may be to pinpoint any one accomplishment that has taken place over the last 100 years as the most remarkable of the decade, there is one aspect of the 20th Century that will remain with me forever. So as we embark on the year 2000, I think it is only fair to call the 20th Century, \"The Century of Democracy.\"\n\tPerhaps, it is because today is November 4th, the day after the U.S. elections. Perhaps, it is because the former superpower of the Soviet Union is now making its transition into a democracy. Perhaps, it is because I am thousands of miles from my home, but I'm feeling very patriotic these days.\n No, I'm not engulfed in the typical ethnocentric idealism of a citizen from the United States. Rather, I'm feeling patriotic because I can look around the world today and see that it is becoming a better place to live for people of all nations.\n\tIn the past 2 years alone, we have seen people all over the world finally take a stand for what they believe. Not too long ago, I remember the democratic demonstrations that caused the people of East and West Germany to unite as one democratic superpower. At the World Expo in Sevilla, not a month ago, I bought a chunk of what was once the Berlin Wall- the Wall that was a symbol to many of the harsh realities of the Cold War. That wall is gone forever and I feel lucky to be among the many who could follow its happening.\n\tThe Soviet Union, as well is going through its own transition to democracy. The many unhappy people of this troubled nation finally took it upon themselves to rid their nation of its communist government.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The turn of the century has brought with it many changes that have greatly altered lives throughout the globe.

It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants.\n\tThe saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so.  The lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling.

In fact, all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives.  If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention of the field, it would have to be the television.  Through the television, news and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening.  This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live, and in a way it has, and continues to shrink the planet we live on.  There are, however, several downsides to the television, and, like all inventions can be used in a useless way.\n\tNot even truly dealing with the amount of television that is watched by the average person, there are several other important ways that television had changed people's lives.  One interesting development has been the use of television in wars.  The vietnam war was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war.  This was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting.  We are able also to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe, and this has led to public concern and effort, for instance, in Somalia.  Of course radio was already able to transmit the sound, but the coming of the picture has had even more significance.\n\tThe greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions of the planet.  Gone are the days of unknown and unheard of areas.  Television is able to bring any part of the world into your very living room within a matter of seconds.  It is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way in which to communicate with populations.  There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing, and this is true.  It is also used in ways that can desensitize one's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real.

The extend to which this invention has altered people's lives is astronomical.  The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people's perceptions of the entire world.  It also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine: the concept of flying.\n\tBefore the invention of the airplane, long distance traveling was a very difficult, time consuming task.  For this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own.  One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease, hunger, and threatening weather;  also as noted above, it was extremely time consuming.  Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world.  I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited.  I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures.  Even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand.\n\tThe invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations.  Since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems, and international business endeavors.  The frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade.

We must remember, however, that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century.  Another \"discovery\" of this past century has been feminism, which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women.\n\tOf course, the issue of feminism is not a new one, but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women (with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s).  As recently as the 1950s, it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home, housekeeping and tending the children.   The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment, which failed.  Even today, the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns.\n\tFeminism does not only have to do with work and money, but also with the image of women.

Today, people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future.\n\tPeople are concerned with nuclear weapons. We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world. Also related to this topic is nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans;  it also kills animals & plants. We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes & rivers. Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w/o being heavily fined.\n\tPeople have also become concerned with nature. We used to assume our natural resources were never ending. Now, though, we realize what we use, needs to be replaced. For example deforestation is a very big issue, many groups have formed to plant more trees. We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively.\n\tAnother important topic we are all aware of is recycling. This links 2 issues, one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products & the other of reusing what we have. (Recycling in a small way also helps those w/o homes b/c they receive money for their collections). Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment.\n\t Another important issue is that of conserving energy. In the past, once again, we assumed our energy was never ending. Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they're not in their rooms, to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources. We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money.\n\tWe have also become more considerable of our animal life. We are no longer able to kill animals freely. We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited & we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction. One realizes that animals have rights too.\n\tIn conclusion, the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one. We are slowly becoming more aware & are beginning to take more precautions.

This awareness extends to the harmful effects of nuclear waste, which not only poses risks to human health but also endangers animals and plants. As a result, efforts are being made to clean up lakes and rivers, with strict penalties for companies that improperly dispose of their waste.\n\nNature and our natural resources are also now at the forefront of our concerns. We have shifted from a notion that natural resources are limitless to recognizing the need for conservation and sustainable usage. For instance, deforestation has become a major issue, leading to the formation of numerous groups dedicated to reforestation efforts. Similarly, the realization that fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively has driven a shift towards more sustainable practices.\n\nAnother critical issue that has gained significant attention is recycling. This practice addresses the problem of nonbiodegradable products while also promoting the reuse of materials. Recycling has not only proven beneficial to the economy in many countries but also significantly contributes to environmental conservation. Additionally, recycling programs have helped individuals without homes by providing them with financial incentives through the sale of collected materials.\n\nConserving energy is another area of increasing concern. Historically, we have taken our energy resources for granted, but today, people are becoming more conscious of the need to save energy. Simple actions, such as turning off lights when not needed and reducing water usage, are becoming more common. These efforts are not only beneficial for the environment but also help reduce household expenses.\n\nMoreover, there is a growing awareness and respect for animal life. Hunting has been limited, and the notion that animals have rights is widely acknowledged. While some animals are still raised for food, their treatment and the potential for extinction have led to stricter regulations and conservation efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of caring for the environment is still relatively new, but it is gaining widespread acceptance and implementation. As we continue to become more aware of the issues at hand, we are taking more proactive steps to protect the environment. These efforts encompass a range of topics, from nuclear waste management and conservation of natural resources to recycling, energy conservation, and animal welfare.", "speed": 0.4650894620718598, "eta": "00h08m03s"}

I have a computer  and my life has change because of it. I'm able to store almost all the information I need for school & for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper & records of all sorts, I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer. This means I'm able to store more information in an organized fashion. Though I have only used a fraction of my computer's ability, I'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have. Aside from being able to store great amounts of info, I'm also able to process & to edit things quickly. For example, without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month & had to this w/ a calculator, a pen & a piece of paper. Of course, this was very time consuming & open to error. W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make. Also, w/ the use of the Word Processor I'm able to edit & rearrange documents w/out altering the entire document, & furthermore, though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer, this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful. My father has the same program in his computer & is able to buy on line tickets w/out leaving the house  & moreover w/out picking up the phone. Also, I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited & that the power of computers, for me, is incomprehensible.\n\tI'm now here in Madrid. How did I get there? Well, I applied to the this program, was accepted, & flew here form the US. But, w/out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University, no doubt. Instead, once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer. W/out this luxury, the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork & things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced. When booking my flight, though I did not do this myself, the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Computers have definitely affected people's lives, and I have personally experienced this transformation. Since acquiring my computer, my life has changed dramatically. Previously, my desk was cluttered with papers and various records, but now I can transfer all of this information to my computer, where it is stored more efficiently and organized. This means that I can retain more information without the physical clutter of paper.\n\nThough I have only used a small fraction of my computer\u2019s capabilities, I am acutely aware of the vast opportunities it offers. For instance, beyond storing vast amounts of information, the computer allows for quick and efficient processing and editing. In the past, I had to balance my checkbook once a month, a time-consuming task that required a calculator, pen, and paper. With a computer, I can program it to handle these calculations, saving me both time and reducing the risk of errors. Additionally, using a word processor, I can easily edit and rearrange documents without the need to rewrite the entire document.\n\nMoreover, the communication program in my computer seems incredibly useful. My father, who has a similar program, can purchase tickets online without leaving home or making a phone call. This convenience is just one example of how computers can streamline and simplify our lives.\n\nMy experience with computers is still relatively limited, and I have only begun to scratch the surface of their potential. For me, the power of computers remains incomprehensible.\n\nCurrently, I am here in Madrid. How did I get here? I applied to the program, was accepted, and flew from the US. Without computers, the process would have been significantly more cumbersome. The application, likely computer-generated, would have been processed by a computer, streamlining the entire process. At the Boston University International Programs Office, without this digital assistance, the secretary would have struggled to manage the paperwork, leading to potential loss or misplacement of documents.\n\nSimilarly, when booking my flight, the transaction would have been nearly impossible without the aid of computers. The entire process, from checking availability to completing the booking, is facilitated by digital systems that ensure accuracy and efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, my journey to Madrid, as well as the many ways I use computers daily, demonstrates the profound impact of technology on our lives. The convenience, efficiency, and organization provided by computers are invaluable, and I look forward to further exploring their capabilities.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Technology is improving every day with smaller, better, faster microchips and advancements.  With respect to the people computers have definantly had a tremendous influence. Not only are companies able to keep enormous amounts of data filed on disks, or chips, but students now have access to a whole new way of learning.\n\tComputers have been a god send for large companies to file large amounts of information.  For example, in libraries, the use of a card catalog is no longer used and books can be looked up on computers.  In hospitals and law firms where the paperwork was endless, much of it is now able to be filed into a neater, easily accesible, computer system.\n\tAs far as students are concerned, computers are revolutionary.  Students no longer have to spend hours trying to type their paper w/o making spelling errors, now they can focus their time on the writing and leave spelling errors for the computer to fix.  Papers can be printed out neatly with whatever margins, font, and size of print the student wants to use.  Computers have therefore made paper writing a much easier task.\n\tComputers can now also be used as great teaching instruments from everything from Biology to understanding of the cosm graph in Mathematics. They have enabled to students to learn in more ways than were previosly used,\nand for some students they have been an incredible useful tool in learning.\n\tThe extend to which computers can be used has just begun to really take hold,  but they is clearly imp in many aspects of our lives.

For example, libraries no longer rely on card catalogs but instead use computers to quickly locate books. In hospitals and law firms, where paperwork was once a mountain to climb, much of this has now been digitized, creating a neater and more accessible system for managing information.\n\nIn the realm of education, computers have been revolutionary.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.  However, this sense of reality is not so distorted, and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman.  As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality, TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "An invention of the 20th century that I believe has significantly transformed people's lives is television.

Previously, people had to wait days or even weeks for news, which often consisted of second- or third-hand accounts that were subject to interpretation and distortion. With television, the world is compressed into a single, global stage where events can be watched live, allowing individuals to form their own, informed judgments. This immediacy also facilitates immediate reactions; for instance, opposition can be swiftly organized against a law or policy before it is finalized, as emotions remain raw and potent.\n\nMoreover, the widespread ownership of television sets ensures that people across the globe receive the same stream of information and ideas, fostering a sense of shared experience. For example, people in Spain can learn about the customs, habits, and lifestyles of people in California or Japan, promoting cultural exchange and dialogue. This phenomenon contributes to the process of making the world a more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has termed it, in the Information Age.\n\nTelevision not only serves as a source of news but also plays a crucial role in entertainment.

This technology allows people to conduct their banking whenever they wish, rather than being restricted to assigned banking hours. While some may argue that ATMs could lead to job losses in banks, we must focus on the myriad of positive aspects they bring to society.\n\nATMs are now ubiquitous in various parts of the world. For instance, in the United States, you can find ATMs in stores, movie theatres, parking lots at shopping malls, and even at banks. The widespread availability of these machines has been particularly beneficial in situations where I have either forgotten my wallet or not had enough money at the grocery store. In such instances, my ATM card has proven invaluable.\n\nMoreover, the use of ATM cards offers an additional layer of security by reducing the need to carry large amounts of cash, which can attract robbers and pose a danger to individuals.

Many coaches in college football run the score up and the NCAA discourages it, or do they.\nThe NCAA has been accusing head coaches like Bobby Bowden, Steve Spurrier, and Tom Osborne of \"running the score up\" on weaker opponents. These coaches allow their teams to score points well into the seventies and make the weaker teams look bad. A prime example of this is the Florida, Carolina game. Carolina was getting their butts beat bad and with just fourteen seconds left on the clock before halftime, coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout so that Florida could score again. Carolina was already losing by four touchdowns. Florida did score with two seconds left. He wasn't done yet because in the fourth quarter Florida was faced with a fourth down and two situation twice and Steve went for it both times each time getting the first down. They eventually scored. The final score was Florida 63 and the Gamecocks 7. I know I made Steve Spurrier sound like a jerk, but who could blame him. Florida held the number two ranking at the beginning of the season, but was eventually knocked down to number three because Florida State was beating their opponents worse than Florida. Florida State was probably the better team, but Florida State lost a game along with it's ranking giving Florida a chance to regain the number two ranking. The following week Florida was playing a really weak team, so coach Steve Spurrier was a nice guy and started his second string quarterback so the game wouldn't be so embarrassing. Florida won by an impressive margin, thinking they would regain the number two spot, but much to their surprise, Ohio State, the number four team, slipped into the number two spot because they beat their opponent worse than Florida. Florida was clearly the better team, so why did the NCAA, who discourages running the score up, give the better ranking to a team that did just that.

Over the years, the question of whether American culture should maintain distinct genre identities has risen. I have come to the conclusion that for psychological, sociological and economic reasons, the culture should maintain gender identitites, but only to a certain extent.\n\tThe stereotyped male image would have a man as being strong, courageous, self-reliant, and the backbone of the family. On the other hand, a woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children. These so called images although maybe pleasant to some people, are not always realistic. For instance a man is not always the strong backbone of the family, the culture makes him out to be. The successful business woman/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\tHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to provide both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of pressure on men, as they aspire to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become so preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them. This is clearly the case in Warren Farrell's book \"Why men are the way they 'are'\", in which Ralph admits that he worked so hard to provide for his family, that he lost touch with them.\nThe other disadvantage of having an ideal male image reflects the issue of sensitivity in men. According to William Masters a social scientist, school age boys are generally expected to show mascularity by demonstrating physical competence and bravery, and are criticized for showing fear or emotions afterall, big boys don't cry.

For instance, a successful businesswoman or a single mother can be the true backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\nMaintaining traditional gender identities to some extent has advantages, particularly in shaping role models for young boys. It helps them develop the strength and resilience needed to support their families both morally and financially. However, this approach also places considerable pressure on men to excel academically and professionally, leading them to prioritize their careers at the expense of family relationships. This was evident in Warren Farrell's book \"Why Men Are the Way They Are,\" where Ralph admitted to neglecting his family due to his intense focus on work and career success.\n\nAnother disadvantage of rigid gender roles is the impact on male sensitivity.

Then we use subclass or ethnicities (black, white; rich, poor; male or female) by act of coercion. This coercion whether it began as a struggle for dominance between two or more ethnicities or not, has invoked stereotypes of each, causing an individual to expect a traditional cause and effect as well as a pre-sought expectation for themselves. Between the struggle of man and woman our history has broadcasted the man as being the dominant figure in a world built for both.

It was once thought that men could have only certain identifying characteristics and, likewise, that women could have only certain identifying characteristics. Today, however, stereotypical behavior is becoming a phenomenon of the past. We, as an ever changing society, should abolish distinct gender identities and recognize the fact that distinct male and female identities can be prevalent in either gender.\"Distinct gender identity\" is not a common phrase and, therefore, requires explanation. Over the years, traditionalists have stereotyped the male gender to be <*>. Likewise, women have also been stereotyped to be <*>. Each set of qualities or characteristics was thought to be possessed only by the specific identified gender. It was also thought to be abnormal if one gender possessed qualities or characteristics of the opposite gender.\nTradition has played an important role concerning distinct gender identities. Today, however, some women are thought to possess male gender qualities and some men are thought to possess female gender qualities. The fact that a man possesses feminine gender qualities does not mean that he is less masculine. Likewise, the fact that a woman possesses male gender qualities does not mean that she is less feminine. William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny, noted researchers, have found that today masculine and feminine traits are looked at separately and that they <*>. Stated differently, a woman who is aggressive and competitive can be quite feminine. Also, a man who is sensitive and loving may also be very masculine.\nTraditionally, women were taught that their greatest goals in life were to be a wife and then a mother. Betty Friedan, a feminist organizer and writer, states that <*>. Many women became unhappy with their lives as a wife and mother and wondered if this was all that life had to offer. These women had always been taught that their distinct gender identity only included traits commonly found in a wife and mother; however, they were not fulfilled. These women were led to believe that if they were not happy fulfilling this role that something must be wrong with them <R>. As a result, they were psychologically affected by their unhappiness and also by their feelings of a lack of self-fulfillment.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the years, too much emphasis has been placed on distinct gender identities, leading traditionalists to stereotype that men could have only certain identifying characteristics and women could have only certain ones. However, as society evolves, these stereotypes are becoming increasingly outdated. Our ever-changing society should recognize that distinct male and female identities can be prevalent in either gender. The term \"distinct gender identity\" might seem unfamiliar, so it's essential to explain it. Traditionalists have long stereotyped the male gender to be authoritative, dominant, and emotionally reserved, while women were expected to be nurturing, passive, and emotionally expressive. It was once thought that possessing qualities from the opposite gender was abnormal, but this notion is now shifting.\n\nTraditionally, gender roles were deeply entrenched, with women primarily expected to focus on being a wife and a mother. This narrow view of female identity, as articulated by feminist organizer and writer Betty Friedan, led many women to question the limited scope of their lives. Friedan argued that women's goals in life extended far beyond these roles and that their fulfillment could not be defined solely by them. Women who did not find happiness in these traditional roles often felt psychologically affected and unfulfilled. The rigid adherence to distinct gender identities meant that any deviation from these norms was considered abnormal, causing significant emotional distress and self-doubt among women.\n\nToday, the lines between traditionally masculine and feminine traits are becoming blurred. Researchers such as William H. Masters, Virginia E. Johnson, and Robert C. Kolodny have found that today, masculine and feminine traits are viewed independently of each other. A woman can be aggressive and competitive and still be considered feminine, while a man can be sensitive and loving and still be considered masculine. The concept of distinct gender identities is losing its relevance as people recognize the fluidity and spectrum of gender traits. This recognition is vital for fostering a more inclusive and supportive society that values individuality and authenticity.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

This establishment of gender identity should begin at the earliest age possible.  Masters and Johnson say children begin to recognize gender roles by age three. (548) Children should be taught that there is a core of behavior that makes them boys or girls but, there are other types of behavior that is open to change.  The message children are given now is a stereotype that has been the root of many problems they encounter later in life.  Men and women today need to understand and respect the fact that they are different.  They communicate in different styles.  This difference is what makes life exciting.

They felt that they didn't do a good job with any part of their life because each demanded more than they could give. Some women, with insight enough to realize they couldn't do it all at once, put off having children until their careers were established, only to discover that their \"biological clocks\" had run out of time before they were ready to interrupt their careers for a family.\n\nThis is not to say that women are the only ones caught in the career trap. Men, too, face similar pressures, often choosing paths they think will be more socially acceptable or more practical, only to find themselves unhappy and unfulfilled.

It holds many different beliefs for different groups of people.  Some view it as a symbol of pride and a heritage that should not be forgotten.  Others may view it as a flagrant sign of hatred and many years of racism.  No matter what one believes that the flag means, they should agree as a group that the battle flag should not be flying over the South Carolina State Capitol.\nI agree that the flag is a sign of heritage for some people.  I agree because I am one of those people who think that the Confederate flag reflects on my history.  I was brought up to respect Southern tradition and way.  Part of that Southern tradition is the Confederate flag.  The South does have a very rich heritage that should be remembered and observed, but not by keeping the Confederate battle flag flying above the state house for all to see.\nI have repeatedly referred to the \"Confederate battle flag\" and the\n\"Confederate flag.\" There is a very big difference.  The flag that is currently over the state house is the battle flag.  It is the flag that is red with blue bars, with stars in them, crossing through the center of it.  In my mind that stands for the South fighting to keep slavery.  It is the flag that the South would carry into battle.  It does not represent the southern way of life, but rather short bursts of fury raging against those who wanted to do away with slavery.\nThe real Confederate flag is much different.  It is the one with three large bars through it, two white and one red.  In the corner of this flag is a large box with stars that form a circle.  This flag means much more than just fighting.  That flag stands for a way of life.  The real flag was the flag that was decided upon to represent the South and what it stood for.

Despite differing interpretations, it is crucial that the flag is not allowed to continue flying over the South Carolina State Capitol.\n\nI agree that the flag represents a part of Southern heritage. Growing up, I was taught to respect Southern traditions, and the Confederate flag is an integral part of that history. The South indeed has a rich heritage, and it is important to remember and observe it. However, this heritage should not be perpetuated by keeping the Confederate battle flag visible to the public. The current flag, red with blue bars and stars crossing through the center, is often associated with the fight to maintain slavery\u2014a narrative that is in stark contrast to the values of equality and justice that have since evolved.\n\nThere is a significant distinction between the Confederate battle flag and the real Confederate flag. The battle flag, the one currently visible at the South Carolina Capitol, is not a symbol of a way of life but rather a reminder of a violent past. It represents the South's willingness to fight against those who sought to abolish slavery. On the other hand, the real Confederate flag, with its three large bars and a box with stars forming a circle in the corner, signifies a way of life and the principles that the South stood for when it decided to become independent. This flag stands for the South's attempt to break away and create a new nation, a narrative that is more complex and less tinged with the legacy of slavery.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Confederate battle flag has historical significance, it is essential to recognize the importance of moving forward and acknowledging the progress made in the fight for civil rights. The flag should be removed from the State Capitol to reflect the state's commitment to a future that values equality, unity, and the principles of the broader American narrative.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

It was supposed to build on what your parents taught you and prepare for the real world and beyond. With all of the rules and regulations it has makes it hard for one to mature in such an environment. It often feels as if there are eyes watching over you at all times. You feel like you are walking on egg shells. There is a rule for everything. It is as if your parents still live at home. The rules don't give you a chance to make a mistake so that you can learn from it. Resident halls are where your biggest rules and regulations lie. They try to take your parent's place. Because of the parenting rolls they play, they have the most problems when it comes to breaking the rules.\nResident halls don't seem to give you enough space to build responsibility. I won't say grow up or become an adult, because those are qualifications that you deal with on your own. The halls have a rule for everything you do. One major rule is the visitation policy. Most policies restrict visitors of the opposite sex in the buildings where students live. If there is no visitation at all, guest of the opposite sex have to be out of the rooms at certain time. For example, the policy at some University of South Carolina dorms state that guest of the opposite sex can be in your room from ten o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the morning. With such a restrictive policy, several resident halls act as governing parents. I thought that when you go away to college you leave your parents at home. For the amount of money spent to live on campus, students should be able to live as they wanted to. I know you think that the time in the example seems like a long time, but why\nshould the student be restricted? Most of the time your guest have to come from some place far and they want to spend the entire day with you. If they arrive at nine they have to wait an hour before they can come up and see you. It feels to them as if they have wasted their time. They did all of that traveling for nothing.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "For many years, college has been regarded as a maturing station where one builds upon what their parents taught them and prepares for the real world and beyond. However, with its strict rules and regulations, it often feels as if the environment stifles the natural process of maturing. The constant surveillance and rigid guidelines can make one feel as though they are walking on eggshells, always on the lookout for potential violations. It's as if one's parents never left, with rules governing nearly every aspect of life. These regulations prevent students from making mistakes, which are essential for learning and growth.\n\nResidential halls exemplify this rigid environment, often taking the place of parental supervision. The strict rules and policies that govern these spaces create a paradoxical situation where students are denied the space to develop responsibility. While growing up or becoming an adult is a personal journey, these halls impose an overly structured regime. One major rule is the visitation policy, which restricts visitors of the opposite sex in dorm buildings. For instance, at the University of South Carolina, guest of the opposite sex are only allowed in rooms from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. Such a policy turns dorms into governing parents, negating the very purpose of leaving home for college.\n\nWhen students pay a significant amount of money for on-campus living, they expect to have the freedom to live as they please. Restricting guest visits, particularly when students and their guests have traveled long distances, feels unfair. For example, if someone arrives at 9 a.m., they might have to wait an hour before being allowed to enter the room, only to discover that the visiting time is already half over. This restriction seems particularly unjust, given that the visiting policy significantly limits the time guests can spend with students, potentially wasting their travel efforts and the time and resources they\u2019ve invested in making the trip.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Some people are very relieved and others are very shocked that Susan Smith did not recieve the death penalty. The news media and many individuals have stated facts as well as opinions, I would like to express my opinion on the justness of the sentence handed down to Susan Smith.\nSusan Smith has had a very disturbing life as a child. Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty. Death would have been quick, easy, and more economical. Susan Smith is now living with a guilty conscience, a sentence that is far greater than death. She will have to live knowing that she is the reason her two sons, Michael and Alex Smith are gone forever.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In 1994, Susan Smith, a mother from Union, South Carolina, chose to end the lives of her two young sons by loading them into her car and driving them into a nearby lake. This heinous act occurred several months after Susan Smith was tried for the murder of her sons. While some people expressed relief that Susan Smith did not receive the death penalty, others were shocked by this decision. As I reflect on the justness of the sentence, I believe it is important to consider the factors that contributed to her actions and the impact of her past on her present decision.\n\nSusan Smith's life has been marked by significant trauma and distress. Her childhood was fraught with instability and tragedy; her parents divorced, and at the tender age of six, her father took his own life. These early experiences likely left deep emotional scars. Additionally, Susan attempted suicide as a teenager, which speaks to her mental and emotional struggles. At fifteen, she faced another layer of trauma when her stepfather began to sexually abuse her. This abuse continued even after she married, and she later had an affair with her boss's son. The dissolution of this relationship deeply distressed her, leading to further psychological turmoil.\n\nIt is clear that Susan Smith's behavior was influenced by a lack of logical mental coherence and poor parental role models. She had a tumultuous relationship with her marriage, and when her boyfriend ended their affair, she believed her sons were the cause. A psychiatrist testified that Susan Smith had a long history of depression, which contributed to her inability to make rational decisions as a mother. If she had been thinking clearly, she likely would have chosen to give custody of her children to her husband rather than resort to such a tragic act.\n\nGiven these factors, it is understandable why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead, they sentenced her to life in prison. While some may argue that death would have been a quicker and more economical solution, Susan Smith now lives with a guilty conscience, a sentence far more profound and long-lasting than death. She will have to endure knowing that she is the reason her sons, Michael and Alex Smith, are no longer alive. This ongoing burden of guilt and responsibility is a form of punishment that is far more debilitating and psychologically taxing than any physical penalty could be.\n\nIn conclusion, while the jury's decision not to impose the death penalty may have surprised some, it was likely the most humane and just decision given the circumstances of Susan Smith's life and actions. Her sentence reflects the complexity of her psychological state and the lasting", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Society and media shouldn't persuade us as to what true beauty is.

Most published works are about decreasing the drug use.  Drugs are here to stay whether anyone likes it or not.  It would be nearly impossible to completely eliminate all of the different drug uses.  People will always find some kind of over-the-counter drug or inhalants, to get high off of.  The legalization of some drugs like marijuana would improve many different aspects of society.\nHealth problems seem to be a concern as far as legalization goes.  Issues such as permanent damage to the brain and other parts of the anatomy.  The fact is that people are going to use drugs anyway, so why not regulate the pureness of some of these drugs.  A majority of drugs relate to or have deadly effects.  Most people do not see marijuana as a drug.  They view it like cigarettes.  Marijuana is probably one of the lease harmful of drugs.  The side effects of marijuana is not apparent as some other drugs.  I do not feel as strongly about legalizing crack cocaine as others.  There are some other things legal today, which can have potentially deadly results.  Lung cancer from cigarette smoke, liver failure from the abuse of alcohol, and the potential loss of teeth and gum damage from chewing tobacco.\n\tIf marijuana among other drugs were legalized, should there be an age limitation? If children obeyed the law, it would be a good idea.  However, they do not.  An age limit would probably just encourage kids to see if they could\nstill get drugs.  Today, kids like to take risks even though there are enormous consequences when caught.  Sometimes, I feel there is a need to eliminate the drinking and cigarettes age law.  I do not know of many people under the age of twenty-one and eighteen that can not get a hold of some alcohol beverages and cigarettes and other tobacco products when they want to.  At my high school the people who were caught smoking underage received the same punishment as the people old enough to smoke.  People will start these habits at young ages, even though it is illegal.  It also starts kids to be interested in fake identification cards.  The product of having these cards is illegal, but it does not stop anyone.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Some people believe that action is required to address drug use.

The legalization of certain drugs, such as marijuana, could improve various aspects of society.\n\nHealth concerns arise as a result of drug legalization, with fears of permanent brain and bodily damage. However, the reality is that people will use drugs regardless, so regulating the purity of certain substances makes sense. Many drugs carry severe and often deadly effects. Most people do not perceive marijuana as a drug in the same category as substances like crack cocaine. Marijuana is generally considered one of the least harmful drugs, and its side effects are often not as apparent as those of other drugs.\n\nWhile I am less supportive of legalizing drugs such as crack cocaine, I acknowledge that some other legal substances, like cigarettes and alcohol, also have potentially deadly consequences. For instance, cigarettes can lead to lung cancer, alcohol abuse can result in liver failure, and tobacco use can cause tooth loss and gum damage.\n\nIf marijuana and other drugs were legalized, an age limitation would seem appropriate. However, enforcing such a limit could be challenging, as children often find ways around the law. Imposing an age limit might merely encourage kids to test the boundaries by attempting to obtain these substances illegally. Today, many teenagers can easily acquire alcohol and cigarettes, and enforcing age restrictions on these products does not entirely prevent underage use. At my high school, those caught smoking underage faced the same penalties as those old enough to smoke legally. This situation prompts the question of whether there is a need to eliminate the legal age limits for alcohol and cigarettes altogether. After all, many young people already find ways to access these products, often through fake identification cards.\n\nIn conclusion, while drug legalization presents both benefits and challenges, the current legal age restrictions for alcohol and cigarettes may be less effective than they appear.

Instead of viewing the enjoyment of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allow the enjoyment of the differences to increase social well. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlining driving force of opposite sex interaction. While men and women are naturally different, the laws of the land must treat everyone equally. With fairness alone in mind there has been a resent social mood to permanently disintegrate the sacred differences between males and females. Men and women can enjoy there differences, especially physical differences, while remaining fair to themselves as well as remaining fair to the opposite sex.\n\tRecently there has been a trend to facilitate an equal playing field for both female and male athletes. By law we should equally fund all sexes sports, but in reality some sports bring in more revenue than others. The classic example is the relatively male sport of football in relation to women's volleyball. At my high school I had people argue about the disproportionally funded sports. They would not necessarily argue that volleyball should get funded equally with football, but that if the football team has the second best facilities in the state then the volleyball team should have the second best facilities. In actuality the football team started out with the worst facilities in the state, but through hard work and years of dedication the football team built up faithful. These faithful have spent there money to boost the football tearn and in doing so boost the football facilities.\nA problem arose when it came time for a new football facility and a new volleyball facility to be constructed, but there were only funds for one or the other. In the end the money got split between the two. This example could be looked at as communism. All the money was split evenly to benefit all. The point here is that if sex was not an issue the football team would have received their money. The fact that there are two sexes in the situation the obvious answer to the problem could not be reached.\nAnother problem that arises from the way we view our differences is in the entertainment industry.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Would it not be wonderful if we could enjoy or even hold sacred the differences between men and women?

While some did not advocate for volleyball to receive the same funding as football, they insisted that if the football team had the best facilities, the volleyball team should also have top-tier facilities.

As a result, the fan-generated funds boosted the football facilities, leading to the debate over funding allocation.\n\nIn the end, the funds were split between the two teams, which could be seen as a form of communism, where resources are evenly distributed to benefit everyone. However, had sex not been a factor, the football team would have received the full funding. This example highlights how the presence of two sexes complicates the decision-making process, preventing the obvious solution from being reached.\n\nFurthermore, another issue arises from the way we view and treat differences in the entertainment industry. Women often face challenges related to their representation and treatment, which can affect their visibility and opportunities. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced understanding of the differences between genders and a commitment to fairness and equality, rather than eradicating those differences entirely.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

For one, most of the professional football players make more money than a college graduate does. Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does.

We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime. Some of the money that they make could be used for good causes.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Should there be a salary cap on the salaries received by professional football players? The answer is a resounding yes, given the multifaceted reasons behind this proposal. For one, professional football players often earn salaries far surpassing those of a college graduate. According to recent statistics, a starting NFL player can make more than a new college graduate, highlighting the stark contrast in earnings. Furthermore, teams should redirect this surplus to improving facilities for fans, enhancing the overall experience and engagement of the community.\n\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? Hardly. While a college graduate might hold a prestigious degree, earning recognition for their academic achievements, the reality is that professional football players are frequently more celebrated. The allure of global fame and immediate notoriety can overshadow the dedication required for lesser-known professions. Doctors and nurses, for instance, dedicate over forty hours a week to saving lives, yet often receive less recognition and compensation. Football players, on the other hand, can achieve significant fame and fortune in their first professional season, often without the same level of tangible contributions to society.\n\nAmerican society needs to reassess the importance of different professions. While we might acknowledge the value of doctors and nurses in critical situations, the prevailing attitude suggests that professional football players are of greater importance. This discrepancy is unjust, especially when a football player's earnings in a single year can exceed a doctor's lifetime earnings. The disparity stems from the fact that becoming a professional football player requires minimal intellectual investment compared to the extensive academic and professional training required for medical careers. A person with a limited academic background can become a professional football player and amass substantial wealth, whereas a doctor must work tirelessly to master complex fields and provide invaluable services to the community.\n\nUltimately, a salary cap on professional football players would not only address this unfair remuneration gap but also redirect funds to more deserving causes, such as healthcare and education. It would ensure that the true pillars of society\u2014doctors, nurses, and other professionals\u2014receive the recognition and support they deserve.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Sex Is used to do everything. I can't remember a time when I have turned on the television and not watched a movie, with a great deal of sex in it. Some of the best shows on television, according to the ratings are shows where everyone sleeps with everyone. Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place are prime examples of overrated sex in the media. In these two shows, if everyone isn't sleeping with everyone else, then the characters are not happy. On Beverly Hills, 90210, everyone on that show has or will have slept with everyone else, by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where sex is everywhere.\nWe also have radio. Now radio is almost as bad as television. Every time I turn on the radio, I either hear a man or a woman saying how things would be alright, if you just make love. Then again some songs don't even have to be listened to, to realize they are talking about sex. \"Sex Me\", by R. Kellye, bluntly saids what the song is about. \"I'll Make Love to You\", by Boyz II Men is another obvious one. Now, these songs don't even have to be heard, just read the titles to know what the song is about. Television and radio are not the only places sex is overrated.\n\tMagazines are also in the large number of those who promote sex. \tAlmost every magazine I have ever read, has ads f eaturing sex. These ads use sex to sell everything from shampoo to cologne. In these ads we have half nude men and women, either by themselves or together promoting sex to sell something. There are these Paul Mitchell shampoo ads, which should probably show the model\u00b4s head, because all we need to see is her hair. Instead, they show a model lying down with a sheet wrapped around her body. Nothing but a sheet. Now if I'm not mistaken, shampoo is used to wash your hair not your whole body, so why show her half dressed body. \"Gravity\", a cologne for men, has ads with a man kissing on a woman, both half dressed, soak and wet on a beach. The slogan reads <*>. Now they only show a little picture of the cologne. You would miss the cologne if you didn't look hard.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Sex in the media is greatly overrated these days, with sex used to do everything.

Television is not the only realm where sex is omnipresent.\n\nRadio contributes to this overreliance on sex as well. It feels almost as bad as television. Whether I'm listening to a man or a woman on the radio, I often hear them espousing that all one needs to do is make love to be content. Many song titles alone are an open invitation to sexual themes. \"Sex Me\" by R. Kelly and \"I'll Make Love to You\" by Boyz II Men are prime examples\u2014these songs don't even need to be heard to know their subject matter. Television, radio, and magazines all partake in this trend, each using sex to sell products and capture attention.\n\nMagazines, in particular, are a key player in promoting sex. Almost every magazine I've read features ads centered around sexual content, using it to sell everything from shampoo to cologne. These ads often feature half-nude men and women, either alone or in couples, to promote products. One notable example is the Paul Mitchell shampoo ads, which strategically show only the model's hair. Instead of a subtle approach, they depict a model lying half-naked under a sheet. Shampoo is meant to clean hair, not a body part, so this excessive display of half-dressed models is unnecessarily provocative.\n\nSimilarly, ads for men's cologne like \"Gravity\" show a man kissing a half-naked woman on a beach, both wet and drenched in the scent being promoted. The slogan reads \"Gravity,\" but the only part of the ad focused on is the half-dressed couple, with the cologne barely noticeable in the background", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

The most common time for a child to watch a program that should be screened from them is when dad is at work and mom is in the kitchen cooking or cleaning. Children starting at age four, generally watch what looks interesting to them. Children like to watch what they call 11 Big people shows\". Those kinds of shows not only interest the children but make the children to want to experiment and do what the people on the shows do. Watching \"Big people shows\" makes the child feel older and grown up. Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch. If you spread that out in a seven day period that's about two programs a day. Let us start when a child gets home from school at\nout three o'clock. On one channel at three o'clock a soap opera is on which has sex, violence, and profanity. At four o'clock Opra talk show is on which has sex and profanity usually. At five o'clock Ricki Lake talk show is on which has sex and profanity. After her show we have the News a game show and then a nigh time soap opera. By this time it's nine o'clock and time for the child to go to bed and out of six hours there was one thirty minute game show that is fit for a child to watch. With these television programs on every day the child starts to watch his or her favorite show and once interested then wants to experiment. Children from ages four to twelve have not been educated about sexuality to understand what they are watching on television.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When people sit down to watch a television program that includes sexual content, they often fail to consider the potential viewership of their children. The most common scenario is when a child watches a program while their parents are at work or engaged in household chores. Starting around age four, children are naturally drawn to whatever interests them, often leading them to watch what they call \"Big people shows.\" These programs not only captivate children but can also inspire them to emulate the behaviors they see, making them feel more grown-up. In the 1990s, busy parents who are focused on providing for their families, cooking, and socializing might not be aware of the content their children are viewing. Moreover, many children possess their own televisions, giving them more autonomy to watch whatever they desire in the privacy of their bedrooms while their parents are busy.\n\nThis leads to a significant issue: approximately 98% of television programs are not suitable for children. That leaves only a small 2% of programs available for them to watch, which equates to roughly two programs a day. If we consider a child returning home from school at around three o'clock, their television schedule looks like this: at 3 p.m., a soap opera with sex, violence, and profanity is on; at 4 p.m., an Oprah talk show featuring similar content; at 5 p.m., a Ricki Lake talk show with sex and profanity; followed by the news, a game show that typically isn't suitable for children, and then a nighttime soap opera. By nine p.m., it's time for the child to go to bed. Out of these six hours, only one 30-minute game show is appropriate for their age. \n\nWith such a limited selection and a saturated schedule, children start to gravitate towards their favorite shows and may begin to emulate the behaviors they observe, often lacking the necessary education about sexuality to fully understand what they are watching.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Americans as a whole have shown that they feel that keeping drugs illegal helps to keep them under control. As drug problems get worse though, a small minority of people have begun to realize the effects drug laws are having on the society of America. They have come to reality and decided that ,drug prohibition has not worked in the past, does not now, and will not work in the future (Duke 231). Drug legalization has many beneficial outcomes and personally I think it' s time we stop wasting money on keeping drugs illegal when it does not even work. America needs to use that money on more important things such as helping the homeless or promoting education.\nOne of the most important benefits of drug legalization is the fact that the prices of drugs would decrease and there would not be as much drug trade. <*> . This would in fact make it more difficult for drug pushers to sell on the streets because <*>.

However, as drug problems have worsened, a small minority of people have begun to recognize the negative impacts of drug laws on American society. They have realized that drug prohibition has not worked in the past, does not work now, and will not work in the future (Duke 231). Drug legalization offers numerous benefits, and I strongly believe it is time for the United States to reconsider its approach, using the funds currently spent on prohibition to address more critical issues such as homelessness and education.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of drug legalization is the potential to reduce drug prices and minimize drug trade. By legalizing drugs, the prices would likely decrease, making it more challenging for drug dealers to sell on the streets. As a result, fewer individuals would be able to make substantial profits from selling drugs, thereby reducing the incentive for street-level dealers to operate. This would, in turn, decrease the availability of drugs on the streets, making it more difficult for drug pushers to find customers.\n\nFurthermore, drug legalization would significantly decrease crime rates. Lower drug prices would reduce the demand for higher-priced illegal sources, thereby decreasing the profitability of drug trafficking. Consequently, fewer individuals would be motivated to commit crimes to obtain or sell drugs. In cities, younger individuals might be less likely to engage in drug-related crime when they realize that the profits from legitimate jobs can be more substantial and stable. Legalization would also mean that fewer resources would be diverted from addressing real criminal activities to apprehending and prosecuting minor drug offenses.\n\nIn addition to these social and economic benefits, drug legalization would free up prison space for more serious offenders. Currently, millions of individuals are arrested and imprisoned for drug offenses, which often do not involve violence or serious criminal behavior. If drugs were legalized, one-third of these individuals would no longer be considered criminals, allowing them to return to their families and communities. This reallocation of resources and focus would not only help reduce the burden on the criminal justice system but also support the rehabilitation and reintegration of individuals into society.\n\nIn conclusion, drug legalization presents numerous advantages, including reduced drug prices, lower crime rates, and reallocation of resources to more critical social issues. It is time for the United States to reconsider its approach to drug policy and focus on more effective and humane solutions.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of a patient's\nrecovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes. A third type of euthanasia is self-inflicted by one's ending of one's life by means of suicide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Sometimes when people suffer from extreme illnesses, they look for other options as a way out, especially when the pain becomes unbearable and medication no longer provides relief.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Society has a double standard for women, a legacy that traces its roots to the past when women were strictly confined to the home, and men were the breadwinners and heads of households.

For those from the older generation, this era marked the beginning of a significant cultural shift. In the early 1900s, women had little to no place in society beyond the domestic sphere, under men's dominant rule. Men served as the leaders and rulers, a position that had been the norm for generations. However, as women began to assert their equality, the status quo became increasingly untenable. The idea that women should be seen as docile, fragile, and emotional beings was challenged. This change in mindset is reflected in the belief that God created Adam before Eve, suggesting that men naturally hold a leadership role.\n\nIn traditional male society, women were often treated like pets, with the expectation that they would only be present to raise children and obey their husbands' every command, with no concerns to distract them from being \"fickle.\" However, women were starting to feel restless, desiring more than just a domestic life. They yearned for equal places in society, the freedom to pursue job positions of any kind, and the right to vote. Men, on the other hand, believed that women belonged in the home and saw their role as providing for the family. This deeply ingrained tradition made it difficult for men to understand why women sought to break away from it.\n\nCentral to the feminist movement is the belief that women are human beings, just like men, and that gender should not dictate one's strength or intelligence. The concept that women are blessed with equal brains to men and that sex discrimination is inherently wrong is a cornerstone of feminism. Since women were perceived as the weaker sex, men established double standards, further entrenching the societal divide.\n\nIn conclusion, the societal double standard for women has deep historical roots but is also being challenged by the ongoing fight for gender equality. This struggle is not just about changing societal perceptions but also about recognizing women's inherent human worth and their rightful place in all aspects of society.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

However the controversy is not over the eleven states leaving, but over the flag they flew.\nSymbols of the Confederacy, still showing today, have taken over newspaper headlines and political conversations across the nation.

These symbols, still prominent in modern times, have become a contentious issue, with newspapers and political discussions frequently referencing them.\n\nSymbols of the Confederacy, including the flag, have taken center stage in national conversations, transcending their original purpose of honoring heritage and ancestors.

Jefferson made this statement back when the federalist and democratic parties were being established. Jefferson believed that in order for the government to operate at the best of its ability, the representatives must act as one. Many Americans are now seeing that this statement, made hundreds of years ago, is today coming true.\nTuesday, November 13, 1995, an event took place that left 800,000 workers out of a job with no pay. This event was so tragic not only because so many people were left without jobs, but also because it should have never occurred. This event is the shutdown of the United States government and it will not end until government officials. decide to work together and solve the problem that started this whole ordeal. I feel the American people elect representatives in the government to keep this from happening. When 800,000 workers, and counting, are out of a job for reasons out of their control, then the government officials are not doing their jobs.\nOctober the first, of each year, is the end of the govermnent's political year. The government year is called the fiscal year. By the end of each fiscal year the government must pass thirteen essential bills in order for the government to continue to operate. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year. This may be the most important bill because without a budget (good or bad), government employees cannot be paid. Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.\nIn many ways this division in power can be good. When a situation arises, there are more point or views to come up with a solution. No one person can control the government in a dictatorship. There are also disadvantages.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "\"There should be no partisan divide in the government; representatives of the people will be divided and without a doubt cause the downfall of the American government,\" as Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, once warned. Jefferson made this statement during a time when the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties were emerging, believing that for the government to function optimally, representatives must act as a united front. This timeless warning is being validated today, as many Americans observe the division within the government is indeed leading to its decline.\n\nTuesday, November 13, 1995, witnessed the tragic shutdown of the United States government, leaving 800,000 workers without pay. This shutdown was not only devastating for the individuals affected but also symbolized a failure of the government to fulfill its duty. The root cause of this shutdown was the inability of government officials to work together and address the underlying issues. The American people elect representatives to ensure such crises are avoided; it is disheartening to see so many out of a job due to reasons beyond their control.\n\nOctober 1st marks the end of the government's fiscal year, a period during which thirteen essential bills must be passed to maintain its operations. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year, a critical document that ensures government employees are paid. Delays in passing these bills often occur because government officials, including Congress, the president, and the cabinet, often hold off until the end of the fiscal year. This timing is driven by the upcoming elections in August, which heighten political tensions and exacerbate division.\n\nIn many ways, this division in power can be beneficial. It fosters a range of perspectives and encourages more robust debate and innovation in policy-making. However, the disadvantages are equally significant. Power struggles between political parties can paralyze the government, hindering its ability to address pressing issues and leading to avoidable crises like the 1995 shutdown. The tension and gridlock that result from these divisions ultimately weaken the government's capacity to serve the public effectively.", "speed": 0.44390299694761415, "eta": "00h07m14s"}

Premarital sex in itself, physically, does little or no harm in its action. The real problems come soon after and have long ranging affects. It is without any doubt that premarital sex is overall destructive because it leads to the lost of respect for women, the birth of illegitimate communities, and even the spread of sexually transmitted disease. Science and government have tried to curb many of these problems, but unfortunately, they never come to the realization that the only way to accomplish that goal is to cut down on have sex before marriage.\nPremarital sex is a problem which did not begin yesterday. It didn't begin ten, twenty, or thirty-five years ago either, but premarital sex has truly changed during that time. The major change, of course, coming thirty-five years ago with the start of the \"Sexual Revolution\" in the sixties. This revolution brought about a sexual awareness. No longer was sex going to be a dark issue. Men and women became more educated about their bodies, how to prevent disease, how to better plan their families, and how to perform better in their sexual roles. Other reforms in gender and racial equality helped keep the revolution rolling. Unfortunately, as with many things, all the good things brought about by greater sexual education had there bad side affects. Side affects like the lowering of moral standards and the loss of person responsibility have made sexual revolution buzz words for when America headed down the toilet. People were given power over their sex and their sexuality, but they lost control of themselves. That power has corrupted people into thinking they can have it all for free. As far as premarital sex is involved, the idea is that \"the reward would be granted before the price was paid, and if this reward were the only thing desired why should one pay the price of marriage after enjoying intercourse\" (Reiss 175) has become prominent.

Who should be number 1? Who should be the national champion? These are the same questions that college football has to face every year and every year these questions seem to be getting more difficult to answer.

However, college football can develop a playoff system and keep their bowl games at the same time. The simple solution to solving one of college football's most complicated situations, the selection of a national championship team, is to have a playoff system in which the top teams compete for the top spot. A playoff system will generate more revenue, create more excitement for the fans because they will be able to see some of their dream match-ups, and most importantly, it will determine a true champion and a true number 1 for college football.\nIn the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship but not without some type of argument from other fans and poll writers. Before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl with the winner earning the national title, there were some poll writers and fans arguing that it should be Florida State and Miami playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State had 1 loss in their record and that was to the Miami Hurricanes. Many poll writers and fans were saying that Florida State was arguably playing the best football in the country at the end of the regular season and they believed that Florida State should have jumped Alabama in the polls from number 3 to number 2 so that they could play Miami for the national championship. Some poll writers had a good argument that Florida State could have jumped Alabama in the polls because near the end of the regular season, Alabama struggled to the Florida Gators, a team that Florida State dismantled a week earlier.

This problem could easily be curtailed by lowering the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen. Changing the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would lower the amount of crimes among young adults, encourage a more responsible approach to alcohol in the United States and improve the health of the nation.

Today, many colleges are experiencing major problems with underage drinking. Many colleges are struggling with enforcing these policies (WWW.mis.duke.edu/Task-forces/Alcohol/Alcohol-chart.html).\nLowering the drinking age would allow colleges to spend more time reforming education programs and aiding students. A high amount of underage drinking occurs in the high school and college environments (US Department of Health and Human Services).

Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, seem to think perhaps shorter time limits and cuts in spending on some welfare programs would be the answer (Silverstein 13-15).  However, the heatedly argued welfare issue can be solved by combining the ideas of both parties.

The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show. Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised, but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager?\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence' pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1).

The NAB accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\" and insisted that broadcasters have already taken steps to address concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\n\nSome television shows incorporate violence because it appeals to adult viewers. For instance, if a plot involves a murder, it must happen, as is often the case (Stern 1). While some may argue that the actual depiction of violence should be avoided, the decision ultimately rests with the creators of the television show. Many made-for-television movies include a disclaimer warning that violent scenes may be present, but how many parents actually watch these shows with their teenagers?\n\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1996 season found that sinister combat violence pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1).

Recycling would include not just the standard aluminum cans and paper bags but also plastic, steel, glass, refrigerators, batteries, and so on. In order for this world to be one that our children and grandchildren can benefit from, recycling needs to become commonplace uniformly.

This includes but is not limited to; plastic bags, containers, cups, toys and hangars.  All plastic products have recycling codes on them somewhere, on the bottom.  The codes have different meanings because if plastics are mixed, it can ruin the melt (Recycler's 1).  Most types of plastic grocery bags can be mixed together.  Even some bags that contain bread, pasta, and marshmallows can be recycled together.  Many plastic products such as compact discs, video tapes, and computer discs are made from mixed materials which can't be recycled unless first disassembled (Recycler's 1).  Corporations that produce grocery bags are starting to realize the importance of being environmentally friendly.  The Superbag Corporation produces their bags with a significant amount of recycled material.  The finished product is completely recyclable and this material can be used in a number of ways (Superbag 1).

With heinous crimes involving guns at an all-time high and people dying at an alarming rate daily, steps for gun control must be taken. Despite some segments of society not taking gun control seriously, it is imperative that measures are implemented to reduce crime, save lives, and lessen the fears of innocent individuals.\n\nThe misuse of guns is evident in numerous instances, such as youths gaining access to firearms and committing murders, and individuals killing others over trivial matters. A tragic example of this is the incident at Blackville-Hilda High School, where a 15-year-old student, Toby R. Sincino, shot and killed two teachers before taking his own life. This event, which occurred on the same day that one of the teachers was released from the hospital, underscores the dire need for stricter gun control, particularly in schools. It serves as a stern reminder for all educational institutions to enhance their security measures to prevent in-school killings involving teachers, students, and staff members.\n\nFurthermore, incidents of gun misuse are not limited to schools but also occur in public places. For instance, at the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Branchville, South Carolina, an armed robber entered the bank, demanding that tellers fill a briefcase with money. This robbery highlights the serious consequences of minimal gun control in public settings. Anybody can walk into these venues with a firearm and perpetrate a crime, thereby emphasizing the necessity for stricter gun control laws to protect the public.\n\nIn conclusion, the need for gun control in South Carolina is clear and compelling. Implementing stricter gun control measures will help reduce violent crimes, prevent tragic incidents, and ensure the safety of all residents.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

The introduction was made necessary by the realignment of the Eastern and Western divisions of the National and American Leagues into the Eastern, Central, and Western divisions.  The realignment produces three Division winners, thus creating the need for a fourth team from each league in order to even up the playoff matches.  The wild card, this fourth team, is decided by taking the team from each league with the best record the three Division winners.  The wild card is good for baseball because it adds more teams to the playoffs, creates another race similar to a pennant race, and provides more competition.\nIn the past, there were only four teams involved in the playoffs which consisted of only two rounds.  Round one, in the old playoff system was known as the League Championship Series where the winner of the National League East played the winner of the National League West and the winner of the American League East played the winner of the American League West.  The World Series was the second round and featured the winner of the National Leagued Championship Series versus the winner of the American League Championship Series.

It seems we are being subconsciously and consciously led to believe that a woman can do anything a man can do without considering the consequences of that concept.\nThe intentions seem honorable on the surface, however when reality comes into play, reality is often altered to accommodate the need to create equality.  For example, when a female enters the military, her intellectual capabilities to enter military service may be the same as a males, however once in the military and given assignments of equal capacities as a male, the standards for a particular routine are sometimes lowered to accommodate the physical weakness of the weaker sex. and goes into the military, her intellectual capability to enter may be the same, however once in the military and given assignments of equal capacity as a male, the standards for a particular routine are sometimes lowered to accommodate the physical weakness of the weaker sex.

Every since the wild west, the civil war, and the drafting of the Declaration of Independance. People under the age of twenty one are considered to be minors, when it comes to drinking alcoholic beverages in the United States. At eighteen you are considered a man, therefore you should be able to decide your own fate and make your own decisions. Eighteen should be the legal age to consume alcohol in the United States. \n\tYou can be condemned to go to war in the United States at the age of eighteen, but you can not drink a beer like all of the other adults over the age of twenty one. Kids are dieing for our country in wars, but the government will still not allow them to drink. How can you think you are a man and fight in combat, when the government says that you are two young to do what all of the other adults. I think if you can hold a gun and fight for your country, you should be able to feel the affects of drinking alcohol.\n\tKids are getting in too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents. Most kids\teighteen to twenty are out of high school, and their parents do not care what they do. A high school diploma should state that you are old enough to make mature decisions. You can say that some kids that are eighteen and over do not have a diploma. You can make a rule that if you do not have a diploma and you are under twenty one, then you are not able to drink. Maybe a higher percentage of teenagers will graduate, thinking that if they had a diploma they would be able to do anything an adult can do.\n\tThere would be less crime in the United States among teenagers, if eighteen year old was allowed to drink. Most crime among teenagers is drinking and driving. They are left with this decision to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents. They cannot drink in their own household, so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Drinking has been a custom in the U.S. for many decades, evolving from the wild west and the Civil War to the present day. Despite this history, the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages in the United States remains at twenty-one, leaving those under this age, including those who have just turned eighteen, in a peculiar position. Eighteen is the age when one is considered a man in the eyes of the law, yet they cannot drink like their peers over twenty-one. This discrepancy is striking: at eighteen, one can be condemned to go to war, yet they are still not allowed to enjoy a beer.\n\nConsider the brave youths who fight for their country, risking their lives in combat. If they are deemed mature enough to fight and die for their nation, why are they not trusted to make the responsible decision to drink? The logic behind this restriction seems flawed. If an eighteen-year-old can handle the responsibilities and risks of war, they should also be allowed to experience the effects of alcohol. The government trusts these young men and women with their lives, but not with consuming a legal beverage.\n\nMoreover, the current system forces many young adults to hide their drinking from their parents. Most kids aged eighteen to twenty are already out of high school, and their parents are often less concerned about their actions. A high school diploma should symbolize a person's readiness to make mature decisions. By linking the ability to drink with having a diploma and being over the age of twenty-one, the government could incentivize higher graduation rates. Teenagers who might otherwise skip school or drop out might be more motivated to stay in high school, hoping to gain the right to drink.\n\nFurthermore, allowing eighteen-year-olds to drink could significantly reduce crime among teenagers. The majority of teenage crime involves drunk driving, a crime that often stems from the need to hide drinking from parents. Without the necessity to hide their alcohol consumption, teenagers would be less likely to engage in drunk driving. If they could drink in their own homes, they would have fewer reasons to seek out risky and illegal drinking spots.\n\nIn conclusion, the current legal age for drinking alcohol in the United States is unnecessarily restrictive. It is illogical to trust eighteen-year-olds to fight in wars but not to enjoy a beer. By aligning the legal age for drinking with other significant milestones, such as obtaining a high school diploma and being over twenty-one, the government could promote maturity, reduce crime, and foster a more coherent system of responsibility and trust.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In an age when government funding cuts loom like an ominous storm cloud, many wonder which area of government spending will be targeted next. While some areas, such as defense, appear justifiable due to the absence of the imminent threat from another superpower, other sectors, particularly government support for the arts, should not only survive but receive increased support.\n\nWhy should the arts, both visual and performing, continue to be supported by government agencies? Anthropology offers a compelling argument. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have sought to interpret and depict their world. These early forms of expression, like cave and wall drawings, have survived through the ages, allowing us to glimpse the essence of ancient thought. This historical precedent underscores the importance of art in documenting our civilization and leaving an enduring legacy for future generations.\n\nMoreover, the arts serve as a powerful medium for communication. Throughout history, leaders like Louis XIV and Napoleon used decorative arts to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns. Similarly, everyday art forms, such as children's drawings, facilitate communication through visual means, allowing ideas to be conveyed precisely and universally.\n\nThe arts also foster community and shared identity. In many ways, participating in the performing and visual arts is akin to engaging in team sports. For instance, a ballet troupe forms bonds as they work together to create and present a production. These collaborations nurtur[e] camaraderie and, often, friendships among performers. For audiences, the shared experience of appreciating the arts can lead to the formation of bonds and friendships over a common interest.\n\nIn sum, the arts are not just aesthetic pleasures but essential tools for communication, legacy creation, and community building. They deserve continued and increased support from government agencies to ensure that future generations can also benefit from and contribute to our shared cultural heritage.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

I feel that, as a woman, there should be strict rules regarding abortions.\nWe all know the consequences of sex, especially unprotected sex and if a person decides to play the game they should be held accountable for the results of their horseplay. I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method that should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.\nWith all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the right to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child. Why can't these women just carry out the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption. Also, some people use money as their excuse. They say they can not afford to have a child. The government gives aid to people that need it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Today, many women feel that abortion decisions should only be made by them and should not concern the government or the nation as a whole.

It is true that a woman has the choice to terminate a pregnancy if she does not want the child, but doing so is not fair to the potential life within her. Instead, these women could choose to carry the pregnancy to term and place the child up for adoption. Additionally, financial constraints cannot be a valid reason for seeking an abortion. The government provides aid to those in need, ensuring that no financial barrier should prevent a person from fulfilling their responsibility to the potential life within them.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that has been fiercely debated for over two decades and continues to expand in scope and intensity. At the heart of this controversy lie two distinct viewpoints: pro-choice and pro-life. The central question\u2014should abortion be legal?\u2014is one that has profound implications for human life and must be addressed.\n\nMany people may feel that this issue does not directly impact them, but almost everyone has a stance or opinion on the matter. Individuals primarily align themselves into two categories: pro-choice or pro-life. However, it is often difficult to determine whether the opinions of those on either side are based on a thorough understanding of the ethical complexities involved. Therefore, the decision to have an abortion should be left entirely to the woman experiencing the situation. She is the only one who can fully grasp the potential consequences and the suffering that the child might endure.\n\nBoth pro-choice and pro-life advocates have presented a variety of arguments to support their positions. While some of these arguments are robust, many are not particularly compelling. For instance, anti-abortion advocates often argue that women who have abortions should not be forced to carry a child to term if they were raped, as rape is something they did not control. However, this argument fails to consider special cases where women may be unwillingly impregnated, such as in cases of incest or when a woman is coerced into sexual activity. Such a narrow perspective on the issue makes the pro-life stance seem unrealistic and insensitive to the broader range of scenarios.\n\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is the \"slippery slope\" theory, which claims that permitting abortion is akin to the Nazi genocide of the Jews. This analogy is often cited as a powerful argument against abortion. However, when examined more closely, the argument falls short. The true definition of genocide involves the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial, or cultural group. Abortion, on the other hand, is a personal decision made by an individual based on various factors such as health, socioeconomic status, and personal circumstances. Thus, comparing abortion to genocide is both inaccurate and misleading.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over abortion is complex and multifaceted, with each side presenting arguments that, while passionate, often fall short of addressing the full spectrum of ethical considerations. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the woman facing the situation, as only she can fully understand the implications of her choice.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

Pink is mainly associated with women. Pink is considered a feminine color. Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are usually pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.\nCommercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, \"Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman,\" the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads have white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.\nPink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed in pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are usually dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would not want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. So if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.\nCommercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girls and Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies for girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.\nAlso baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs are also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys. A specific example is the Gerber bottles and dishes.\nAs for males, baby boys especially, blue is the\nstereotypical color. Baby boys are associated with blue. Just like baby girls, baby boys when brought from the hospital are usually dressed in blue.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When you see pink, what comes to mind?

When mothers bring their baby girls home from the hospital, they are typically dressed in pink, especially in the early weeks. Even as infants develop, parents find it acceptable for baby girls to wear blue. However, to avoid any confusion, mothers ensure that someone seeing a baby in pink immediately recognizes it as a girl. This stereotype is further perpetuated in commercials, such as the Huggies diapers commercial, which clearly differentiates between products for girls (pink) and boys (blue).\n\nBaby products, like bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs, also conform to these gender stereotypes. For example, Gerber products often come in pink for girls and blue for boys. Conversely, baby boys are associated with blue. In hospitals, baby boys are typically dressed in blue, aligning with the broader societal norms that associate blue with male infants.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

Currently capital punishment is being left up to the individual state as to whether or not they decide to implement it as a form of punishment.  Advocates of this obscene form of punishment offer a handful of reasons justifying it's use.  At first glance these reasons seem to hold up, but one by one I will show you that these reasons are as ridiculous as the source they are trying to endorse.  Ounce society is enlightened of these statistics, they will see that capital punishment has no place in the justice of\nthis country.\nThe first claim of supporters is that they are under the opinion that it is much more expensive to keep a convicted criminal in prison for life than to simply pull their plug.  At first glance this statement seems to be more than rational.  The problem here is that people don't realize the big picture of the situation at hand.  Instead of capital punishment saving tax payers money, it actually does the complete opposite.  Let me throw a couple of statistics at you that I gathered doing a paper last year.  Currently to administer capital punishment upon a single individ ual it costs five times the amount than it would to inprison somebody from the age of eighteen to eighty years old.  How this statement can be valid is due to the reasons that when someone recieves the death penalty they are not killed the next day.  Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years.  During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals.  These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs.  When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system.  This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system.  So if the cost of punishment is at all a concern for you, then it is obvious that capital punishment is the wrong\ndirection to go.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Capital punishment has been in debate since early hangings and will continue to be a subject of controversy until our society identifies the irrationality of its existence in our judicial system.

Several years ago I considered myself to be an avid reader. However lately, I feel the quality of their news has begun to go down. I remember last year when I was- interviewed by a representative of \"The State\", on the patio of the Russell House. I told them at that time that they had lost the quality of their news, and the price was just too high for what they had in their paper.\nOver the passing years, I have come to know a \"new media.\" It is no longer the media of my younger years. Then, newspapers, radio and television were successfiil without dragging up all kinds of dirt on any and every person or event that came along.\nI guess my realization of this \"right to know\" came when United States troops were sent into Grenada in the 1980's. The media's \"right to know' was unknowingly broadcasting troop movements to the enemy, endangering the fives of our young people. As a parent of one of these young people, I was appalled and infuriated. How dare they endanger lives with their \"right to know\". It happened again in Desert Storm and Bosnia. What happened to waiting for the battle to end before the cameras and lights went on? I suppose this might come under the people's 'right to know\", however, I am sure they would hope that the sons and daughters they sent to fight, would at least have a small chance of surviving the first impact before someone told the enemy where they were. Watch out, future warriors of this country. It may be your turn to step up in front of a camera when you least expect it. \nIn the early 1990's, the United States was looking for a new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders. The media took a perfectly good candidate, who probably would have made an excellent Surgeon General, and dug up as much dirt on him as possible. They found he had performed four abortions and despite the other good things this person may have done in his life, he was rejected on this reason.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "This topic came to me on Friday night when \"The State\" called to solicit a subscription to their newspaper.

For instance, during an interview last year at the Russell House patio, I expressed these concerns to a representative of \"The State,\" warning them that they had lost the quality of their news and that the price was unjustified for what their paper offered.\n\nAs time passed, I came to realize the significant changes in the media landscape. The traditional media\u2014newspapers, radio, and television\u2014once thrived without needlessly exposing every person or event to public scrutiny. My awakening came during the 1980s when United States troops were sent into Grenada. The media\u2019s relentless focus on troop movements inadvertently broadcasted information to the enemy, jeopardizing the lives of young soldiers.

Similar issues resurfaced during Desert Storm and Bosnia, where the media\u2019s relentless pursuit of immediate reporting compromised the safety of soldiers. It is disheartening to see how the \u201cright to know\u201d has evolved to prioritize immediate information over the safety of our soldiers.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the media faced another controversial incident during the search for a new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders.

There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the past few years, a question has repeatedly arisen in courts: should women be allowed to attend The Citadel? This debate has sparked numerous objections, yet many equally passionate individuals believe otherwise.\n\nWhenever the argument against women's admission is presented, two key points often surface. First, it has traditionally been an all-male institution, and second, women might not be able to handle it. It is true that The Citadel has a long-standing tradition of enrolling only males, but, as the saying goes, \"traditions are meant to be broken.\" Just as societal changes have led to the abolition of black slavery and the shift away from the notion that women should be mere housewives, so too must traditions evolve to reflect contemporary values and necessities. Over time, certain aspects of society fade away, while others become more significant. Most traditions are broken not for trivial reasons, but to benefit society or to promote greater equality. While some might wish to believe we live in an equal society, as a woman, I know that equality is not yet a fully realized reality. Though society has made substantial progress, many inequalities still persist.\n\nIt is also important to recognize that men and women are equally capable. Not all men have the strength, intelligence, or aptitude to handle the duties of attending The Citadel, just as not all women do. Physical strength is indeed a factor, but it is not the only one. Some women might not meet the physical requirements, but others certainly could. The key point is that all individuals deserve the chance to try. \n\nIn a country where public schools are funded by the government, there is a legal obligation to ensure non-discrimination based on race, religion, gender, or disability. The Citadel, being publicly funded, is bound by the same rules as other schools. If it were to exclude women, it would create a significant anomaly.

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and as of today, it remains a contentious issue that shows no signs of disappearing. It is clear that marijuana use is increasingly widespread, with even high-ranking officials, such as the president, acknowledging its use. Recently, many politicians have begun discussing the possibility of legalizing marijuana. However, until there is overwhelming public support, significant changes to marijuana laws are unlikely.\n\nThe purpose of this passage is not to persuade you one way or the other regarding the legalization of marijuana or stricter enforcement of current laws. Instead, it aims to provide you with all relevant facts so that you can make an informed decision. It is every American's right to form opinions and make choices regarding government policies, but often, these decisions are based on a lack of knowledge or preconceptions. There is nothing inherently wrong with choosing to keep marijuana illegal, provided it is done with justifiable reasons.\n\nThe first step in forming a stance on marijuana involves examining its history in the United States. Marijuana was federally banned in 1937, but in 1980, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills (the active ingredient in marijuana) to cancer patients to help control nausea. More recently, the FDA has also approved marijuana cigarettes for glaucoma patients to increase appetite. In 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substances known to man.\" Despite these developments, more than 400,000 people are arrested each year on marijuana charges, highlighting the complex and often contradictory nature of its legal status.\n\nTo further inform your opinion, the next step is to consider the physical effects of marijuana. Short-term effects include the \"high,\" increased heart rate, and diminished coordination. Long-term effects are similar to those of smoking cigarettes, including an increased risk of mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Additionally, chronic users (more than once a day) often exhibit signs of short-term memory loss.\n\nAfter addressing the physical effects, it is essential to examine marijuana's impact on mental health.

In New Hampshire,, the magazine, Ms. , was considered to be inappropriate for the reading of high students. Nashua's Board of Education felt that speaking openingly about vibrators, contraceptives, materials on lesbianism and witchcraft was not acceptable. In the court case,, Salvail v. Nashua Board ofeducation, the board was unable to provided the court with a legitimate reason for its removal; therefore, the magazine returned to the shelves of the school library.\nUnfortunately, in the Arapahoe School District, the School Board was allowed to ban five books without reason. Though this fact was presented in a the case of Cary v. Board of Education, and it was clearly stated that the teachers First Amendment rights were violated, nothing could be done. The First Amendment gave those teachers the right to choose their text books but their rights were waived under an previous agreement with the school district.\nAs if it were not enough that the teaching curriculum and student's education is immensely limited because of constant attempt of groups such as CEE, Blackstone Society, and Rutherford Institute, many public libraries are feeling the strain.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Who holds the authority and responsibility to prohibit the reading and studying of certain texts?

It seems to me that the politicians should look at the judicial system as a place where some changes could cut costs. In particular, I wn t~g about the court of common pleas or civil court. This is the judicial forum where lawsuits are heard. Are all of these lawsuits necessary? Seems like everybody is suing everybody these days. Lawsuits seem to have become a way for a lot of people to make a living. How many lawyers do you see advertising now a days? They want to represent you if you are hurt on the job, or if you slip and fiLI1, and especially if you are involved in an automobile accident. It costs millions of tax dollars to support the system of litigation for all these lawsuits. Courthouses have to be built, judges and hundreds of administrative employees have to be paid. Jurors have to be paid, not to mention the wnount of time wasted by jurors to hear these ridiculous cases. Hundreds of lawsuits are filed by ft~tes in the prison system. They have time on their hands and law libraries at their disposal. Inmates file suits for just about everything you can imagine. For example, ft~tes have filed suit because they do not like the flavor of ice cream they are being served. bmtes have sued because they are not allowed to wear their hair the way they want to, and I heard of a case last week in which a male inmate sued the state because he was not allowed to wear female underwear during his incarceration. It costs thousands of taxpayers dollars to pay lawyers to represent the state against these frivolous lawsuits.\nThere have been several rings of accident stagers arrested recently. These people fake accidents in order to sue and collect money from insurance companies with the corporation of lawyers, chiropractors, and sometimes medical doctors. It cost you and I millions in insurance cost to payoff these fake claims. It seems as though accidents have become something to make a profit off of. People are encouraged by the large number of lawyers on television, radio, and billboards begging for people to call them if they happen to hurt their back.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the 1990s, there was a noticeable trend towards less government involvement and efforts to save taxpayer dollars, often resulting in the reduction of social programs. However, one area that could significantly reduce costs is the judicial system, particularly the court of common pleas or civil court. This is the judicial forum where lawsuits are heard. Are all of these lawsuits truly necessary? It seems that lawsuits have become a common way for many people to earn a living, with advertisements now ubiquitous for lawyers representing those injured at work, those who slip and fall, and those involved in car accidents. The maintenance and support of the litigation system cost millions of taxpayer dollars. For instance, courthouses need to be built and maintained, judges and numerous administrative employees require salaries, jurors are compensated, and there is a significant amount of time wasted by jurors listening to what appear to be frivolous cases. Furthermore, thousands of lawsuits are filed by inmates in the prison system, who have ample time and resources. They file suits for a wide range of issues, from the flavor of ice cream they are served to the right to wear their hair as they wish. Recently, there was even a case involving a male inmate suing the state for not being allowed to wear female underwear during his incarceration. Each of these lawsuits costs taxpayers thousands of dollars in legal fees.\n\nMoreover, recent arrests of accident stagers have highlighted another significant source of wasteful spending. These individuals fake accidents to garner money from insurance companies, often with the assistance of lawyers, chiropractors, and even medical doctors. This fraudulent activity not only increases insurance costs for everyone but also encourages a culture where accidents are seen as a way to profit. The pervasive advertising by lawyers on television, radio, and billboards, urging people to call them if they have injured their backs, contributes to this culture. It is clear that addressing these systemic issues could lead to substantial cost savings for taxpayers.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical/literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music. All these examples (and more) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know. \nThe stories told in this genre of literature, however, are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature. It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States. When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity. The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference. Without learning about the past (and present) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Our country has been referred to as a \"melting-pot,\" suggesting that individuals from diverse backgrounds have joined together to create a unified American identity. However, recent realizations emphasize the critical importance of one's heritage to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures are now reviving and seeking to reestablish their roots, which were once severed in the pursuit of a model U.S. citizen. The rediscovery of these differences adds vibrant colors, flavors, and excitement to our collective \"pot\" of American identities. Yet, some individuals and groups react negatively to this ethnic explosion, particularly through the arts. They resist accepting these differences, choosing instead to remain indifferent to the struggles of their fellow Americans.\n\nAs Elie Wiesel, the author of Night, poignantly states, indifference is the antithesis of everything good\u2014love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, and growth. Ethnic American literature strives to combat this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing the nuances of various American cultures. The scope of this literature is vast, each group contributing its own distinctive peculiarities and attributes that make their writing unique. For instance, Native American poetry often reflects a deep connection to nature, with a language rooted in visual and sensory experiences. Chinese American literature tends to be philosophical and literal, mirroring the nature of their native language. African American literature, on the other hand, often boasts a melodious and rhythmic quality, echoing their rich musical heritage in jazz and blues.\n\nThe stories in this genre of literature are particularly significant. Through the experiences of the characters, we gain insight into the diverse cultures within the United States. When we empathize with the trials and hardships of these characters, we can better accept and understand diversity. The stories of black American slaves and concentration camp victims are crucial in combating indifference. Without learning from the past and present horrors, we cannot ensure a more humane future.\n\nIn essence, ethnic American literature not only enriches our understanding of various cultural heritages but also plays a vital role in fostering empathy and acceptance among Americans.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

The protagonist is singled out among the characters of the ethnic literature to convey the purpose of the author's work. Ethnic American literature implies that the ethnic protagonist's search for an identity within a society is not to set him apart from his culture selfishlessly, but to achieve, excell, and contribute to the culture of which he is associated. The protagonist is confused as to his role within society, but searches for that identity and role for the benefit of the many.\nThe protagonist is challenged by society to prove his value as an existing member. In that challenge, the character is faced with an examination of his or her role within the society. Celie, the protagonist of The Color Purple, must find inner strength to overcome the hardship placed on her by the male society. The desired result of the character's quest is not material wealth or spontaneous gratification, but a freedom to make a difference. Elie Wiesel pointed out that his autobiographical work Night was written to present a detailed account of the Jewish experience in the Nazi concentration camps, not to promote his own achievement in surviving. The important issue to examine in a protagonist's journey against society is the deference of gratification to the entire culture.

The clerk's action, while an act of tolerance, demonstrates the underlying lack of acceptance and understanding. Barbara Jordan Cleary emphasizes the need for broader acceptance and inclusion among all Americans, echoing the sentiments that \"all Americans need to be accepting of other cultures.\" \n\nReading ethnic American literature illuminates the harm caused by non-acceptance. African American spirituals clearly express the desire to escape from a place that does not accept them, singing about the need to leave and return to a better, more accepting home. Martin Luther King Jr. also underscores the necessity of changing non-accepting attitudes, stating, \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" King desires a world where all Americans accept and value each other as brothers and sisters. In *The Conversion of the Jews*, Ozzie pleads for acceptance, crying out against his mother's selective mourning, wishing for all the deceased to be remembered equally. Similarly, June in Amy Tan's *The Joy Luck Club* cries out for acceptance, tired of her mother's relentless attempts to turn her into a \"prodigy\" and longing to be recognized for who she truly is. Her journey of self-discovery ultimately reveals the importance of embracing her Chinese heritage. \n\nNon-acceptance is not only harmful but also perpetuates division and misunderstanding among different cultures. Through the voices of these literary characters, we are reminded of the power of acceptance and the importance of fostering a society that values and respects all its members.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

To an extent, I think that characters in all of the works covered over the semester are victims of forces inside and outside themselves. It is usualy only through force-of-will that characters break free from the circumstances of their naturalistic lines.\nAs is necessary for a literature to be considerred \"ethnic\", a seperate culture must be delt with. And aspects of these different cultures have different naturalistic implications. Take, for instance, the Chippewa tribal and religious structures that define the conflicts of the characters in Erdrich's Love Medicine. The effects of these conflicting elements have devious effects on the confused lives of Nectar, Marie, Albertine, Henry Jr, and June. Each of these characters battles against the naturalistic effects of white versus Native American thinking. should they form a tribal family, or a nuclear one? should they worship God, or Gods? And do they respect the government, or themselves? Each of these questions is representative of naturalistic battles going on in the character's lives. The same can be said for the characters in Philip Roth's works. A recurring theme faced by many of the characters is how to exist in the modern world and still retain the beliefs and discipline of the Jewish faith. These conflicts arise simply from the fact that these people were born Jewish, a situation that has great influence but is clearly beyond their control.\nWomen, in particular, find it difficult to accept the stereotypical roles assigned to them, and I can hardly blame them. I can see no reason why Celie should find contentment in cooking and cleaning for M.- jus so he can reward her by beating her some  more. Should Tita be happy? I find no cause for rejoicing in the fact that she is not allowed to marry and must watch her true love marry her sister in order to service the selfish needs of Moma Elena. How can we expect the women of the Joy Luck Club to overcome the centuries of strictly adhered-to traditions of female subsurvience, to defy a nation? clearly, we can not. Part of what make these works great is how the characters overcome the naturalism that has thus-far dominated their lives.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I firmly believe that naturalism is one of the most prominent ideas presented by writers of ethnic American literature. Characters in these works are often victims of forces, both internal and external, and it is usually only through a strong force of will that they break free from the circumstances that define their naturalistic lives. To be considered \"ethnic\" literature, a distinct culture must be at the forefront, and the implications of these different cultures vary significantly. For instance, in Erdrich's *Love Medicine*, the Chippewa tribal and religious structures define the conflicts faced by characters like Nectar, Marie, Albertine, Henry Jr., and June. These conflicting elements have devious effects on their lives, as they battle between traditional Native American thinking and the influence of white culture. Each of these characters faces naturalistic questions, such as whether to form a tribal family or a nuclear one, whether to worship a single God or multiple deities, and whether to respect the government or themselves. \n\nSimilarly, in Philip Roth's works, the characters are often caught between their Jewish heritage and the pressures of modern society. They must navigate conflicting forces in their quest to retain the values and discipline of their faith while also adapting to the modern world. These conflicts arise simply from the fact that they were born into a specific cultural and religious tradition, which has a profound and uncontrollable influence on their lives.\n\nWomen in these works, in particular, struggle with the stereotypical roles assigned to them. Celie in *The Color Purple* finds no reason to be content with a life of cooking and cleaning, only to be beaten further. Tita in *Like Water for Chocolate* also cannot find reason to rejoice in being constrained by tradition, unable to marry her true love and instead serving the selfish needs of her mother. The women of *The Joy Luck Club* are similarly burdened by centuries of traditional female subservience, a challenge that seems nearly insurmountable.\n\nWhat makes these works great, however, is how the characters ultimately overcome the naturalism that has defined their lives. Despite the overwhelming forces against them, these characters find the strength to change their circumstances, often through a combination of resilience, courage, and a refusal to accept their predetermined roles.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

For example, in Walker's The Color Purple, the characters attend church regularly as almost anyone else in todays society. They also encouter racism, domestic violence, poverty, war, etc. Like the characters of The Color Purple, the characters of Tang's The Joy Luck Club also possess similar characteristics and encounter similar situations: war, discrimination, poverty, war, etc. These characters also feel the need to create a special bond amongst its members in order to preserve and uphold their culture. These are all universal characteristics that every culture possess. According to Stuart Hirschberg, <*>. I agree with Hirschberg's remarks. Reading about only one's culture is very eckusive, for one's only reading what one has always been brought up to know about oneself. However, as one ventures the life experiences and identities of others, one can relate these to one's own experiences and identities, thereby broadening one's own knowledge about oneself. \nOne's knowledge about oneself is broadened by venturing the life experiences of different cultural backgrounds. By reading The Color Purple one sees that the Character a great deal of racism. For example, Sophia is brutally beaten and put in prison for refusing to become the maid of the mayors wife. Although she does slap the mayor, he hits her also but wasn't beaten or put in jail. Also, sees that blacks who went into the stores weren't attended to with proper care. Also, in Weisel's Night the Jews are exclusively evacuated from their land and dehumanized by the Germans simply for being Jews. The characters also experience war: the Mexican war takes place in Like Water for Chocolate; the war of the English takes place in The Color Purple; the Japanese-Chinese War takes place in The Joy Luck Club, etc. Domestic abuse is also depicted in these novels, as well as the unity and togetherness of the characters.

Both are true but the second one has to be embraced and understood before the first motto can become a reality. In America, there are real characteristics that are unique to each race that every American needs to come to understand an accept. Ethnic American literature is bridge that all American can use to help them come to an understanding and acceptance of people of other backgrounds. If oneday America as a whole is enlightened in this manner, then we can honestly say our national motto is \"from the many, one!\" Ethnic American lit. can help us accomplish this goal because it helps us to understand.\nEthnic American Literature will help each group of people understand what the other group of people has gone through. Every single ethnic group has suffered a great amount in their attempt to gain equality. That suffering they have gone through has left many wounds that have not totally healed. Knowing why those wounds are there help to clearify why people do the thing that they do today. Ethnic American literature explains why those wounds are there and usually the literature presents to the people a way to overcome the wounds. For example, in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club the Chinese American daughters have a tough time understanding themselves because they are caught between two cultures that clash in values. The girls are the victims of the clash because they do not know which culture to follow. The Chinese culture gives them no choices, and the American culture gives them too many choices. Consequently, the girls are lost and do not know who they are. Ian advises that they should listen to their mothers. When the girls listen to their mothers they find out who they are. From reading this book, I have become more sympathetic to the Chinese-American's dilemna.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The national motto is \"E Pluribus Unum,\" and ethnic American literature preaches the importance of embracing diversity. At first glance, these two mottos may seem to conflict, but they are both true and interconnected. In America, the unique characteristics of each race are essential for every American to understand and accept, and ethnic American literature serves as a bridge between different communities. Through this literature, Americans can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of one another, ultimately leading to the realization of the national motto: \"from the many, one!\"\n\nEthnic American literature helps each group of people understand what the other group has gone through. Every ethnic group has experienced significant struggles in their quest for equality, leaving deep, unresolved wounds. Understanding the origins of these wounds can clarify why people behave in certain ways today. Ethnic American literature not only addresses these wounds but also provides a pathway to healing and unity. For example, in Amy Tan's *The Joy Luck Club*, the Chinese American daughters struggle to reconcile their dual cultural identities, feeling lost between the strict expectations of their mothers and the overwhelming freedom of American culture. The literature presents a way forward, as the daughters discover their true selves by listening to their mothers. This process of understanding and healing is crucial for fostering a more cohesive society.\n\nBy providing insight into the historical and cultural experiences of various ethnic groups, ethnic American literature helps to bridge the divides that have long existed in American society. It offers a window into the past, allowing readers to empathize with the challenges faced by others. Through this empathy, we move closer to the ideal expressed in our national motto: a unified America that values and respects its diverse heritage.", "speed": 0.4449139401312382, "eta": "00h06m01s"}

However my question is how will we learn about cultures in America if close our eyes to the violence, conflict, or confrontation? All literature should bring us closer to our surroundings.\nAlthough there is some violence in ethnic American literature it should not be the only focus, because some classics contain violence and that was somehow overlooked. The themes that ethnic American literature focuses on are hope, cultural traditions, and the struggles of the characters which is common in most works. For example, Alice Walker's The Color Purple is brutally violent, but under the surface one notices and finds that Celie struggles to survive as a woman, a wife, and a mother but ultimately struggles to survive as an individual. We learn about the ways of African-American culture; we denounce it at first, then we learn to accept it and finally we understand it. The same is true for Toni Morisson's novel Jazz. Although it takes place in the heart of Harlem and violence is predominant occurance, the reader looks deeper and finds a stimulating story about lost love, inner city conflicts and again the struggles of survival. Many ethnic American writers, use violence in their novels as a way to emphasize their points. One great example is Esquivel's novel Like Water for Chocolate. The novel is filled with magic-making, the violence or love scenes spectacular.

The quest of finding out who one is is the quest that all individuals must embark before they can truly embark on any others. We all must attempt to understand the self as children of God so we can operate harmoniously with each other and so we can know our own purposes and know in what specific way each of us was meant to give back. To say writing about this topic is selfish is to show a great lack of understaning of human nature. The writers of ethnicity that have written on the subject of \"Who am I?\" have been anything but selfish. They have given a great gift to the people of their own background, as well as and maybe even a greater gift to the rest of humanity.\nThe Ethnic American Authors' addressing of the issue of self understanding is hugely important because of the adverse circumstances that all American of ethnic backgrounds are subjected to. For example, in Alice Walker's The Color Purple Celie, because she is black, is born with an inferiority complex. She is born into society that is trying to crush her and any self-respect she might have because she is black, and female. She is thought of as and treated as nothing. Therefore she naturally thinks of herself as nothing. Walker shows African Americans that they must find a self-understanding that is void of the standards that were and are imposed upon them by the white race. Because of the situation the African-Americans have been subjected to self-growth and understanding among the people may have been stunted. For Alice Walker to address this issue is anything but selfish. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The central quest for the ethnic protagonist is to answer \"Who Am I?\" as their central quest should be. This quest of self-discovery is universal, as all individuals must first understand themselves before embarking on any other journey. To grasp our identities as children of God is essential for harmonious human interaction and for knowing our unique purposes in life and the specific ways we can contribute. To claim that writing about this topic is selfish is to misunderstand human nature. Ethnic American authors, such as Alice Walker, who address the issue of self-understanding, have provided invaluable gifts not only to the people of their own backgrounds but to humanity as a whole.\n\nAddressing the issue of self-understanding is crucial for ethnic Americans, particularly given the adverse circumstances they face. In \"The Color Purple,\" for example, Celie, a Black woman, is born into a society that seeks to diminish her and her sense of self because of her race and gender. She is treated with disdain, leading her to internalize a sense of worthlessness. Walker's portrayal of Celie and her eventual journey toward self-acceptance is not selfish but empowering. It helps African Americans, and indeed all readers, recognize the importance of finding a self-understanding that transcends the oppressive standards imposed by the dominant culture. The situation African-Americans have faced has potentially stunted self-growth and understanding, making Walker\u2019s exploration of this issue all the more significant and essential.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

The transmission of culture is a very important aspect of ethnic American literature. Many ethnic American writers show the importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native country.\nMany of the novels we have read this semester show this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. The mothers want to desperately hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters \"the Chinese way\". They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are. Where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues. The daughters find this hard to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions - the doors for transmition of culture have been opened. Amy Tan's novel ends with this important aspect of ethnic literature. Another novel that shows transmition of culture is Walker's The Color Purple. Celie's sister Nettie goes off to Africa as a missionary. Once there she tries to transmit African-American culture to the natives. And finally Mama Elena tries to transmit culture to Tita and her other daughters in Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate. Mama Elena fails miserably with Tita and Gertrudes but manages to influence Rosaura with the old ways.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The American Heritage Dictionary defines culture as \"<*>.\" The transmission of culture is a critical aspect of ethnic American literature, often highlighting the importance of passing down traditions and customs from one generation to another. Many ethnic American writers emphasize this aspect to uphold the rich heritage of their native countries.\n\nThis theme is prominently featured in the novels we have read this semester. For instance, Amy Tan's *The Joy Luck Club* serves as a prime example. The mothers in the novel desperately want to hold on to the old ways of China and raise their daughters according to the \"Chinese way.\" They share stories of their homeland, explaining the origins of their heritage, the significance of their customs, and the reasons behind their behaviors regarding certain issues. However, the daughters have been \"Americanized\" and find these stories challenging to understand. By the end of the novel, the daughters come to understand and accept their mothers' traditions, symbolizing the successful transmission of culture. This resolution marks the culmination of ethnic literature's focus on cultural inheritance.\n\nAnother notable example is Alice Walker's *The Color Purple*. In this novel, Celie\u2019s sister Nettie travels to Africa as a missionary, where she attempts to transmit African-American culture to the natives. Similarly, in Esquivel's *Like Water for Chocolate*, Mama Elena tries to impart her cultural heritage to her daughters, Tita and Gertrudes, though her efforts are largely unsuccessful. However, she manages to influence Rosaura with the traditions of her homeland.

Although such a show of strength by these works' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author, it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.\n\nIn the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mother's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show. This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature cannot be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In many of the minority works of modern literature, there is often a strong emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces. While such displays of strength are sometimes perceived as violent and thus negative, they are integral to the narratives of many stories in ethnic American literature. However, this kind of conflict is not uniformly present in every minority work, meaning that ethnic American literature cannot be solely categorized as a product of years of oppression. Instead, the ever-changing and ever-challenging nature of minority literature necessitates that each work be considered individually, acknowledging both its historical context and its unique qualities.\n\nThe conflicts and rebellions depicted in these works accurately reflect broader societal issues, as seen in the mothers in *The Joy Luck Club* who rebel against arranged marriages, Tita in *Like Water for Chocolate* who fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in *Love Medicine* who struggle for their inherent rights from the U.S. government. These characters\u2019 struggles echo similar conflicts faced by other cultures, with Celie in *The Color Purple* resisting her own arranged marriage and the destructive passion in *Jazz* mirroring Tita and Pedro\u2019s in *Like Water for Chocolate*. Rebellion and conflict are central themes in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than in other pieces of literature. Each work emphasizes these themes to varying degrees, and while figures of authority are particularly oppressive in some, such as *Like Water for Chocolate* and *The Color Purple*, other minority works like *Love Medicine* and *Jazz* do not feature the same clearly defined authority and rebellion.\n\nThis again underscores the idea that these ethnic American pieces of literature cannot be categorized as mere rebellious responses to oppression.

Violence then, is a part of their everyday lives.

The traditions and cultures portrayed in ethnic American literature provide the reader with an opportunity to explore emotional and social experiences of ethnic characters with the turn of a page. These characters provide a foil by which the reader can modify, adapt or reexamine the lifestyle or beliefs which he or she currently holds. \nThe power of ethnic American literature comes from the authors' abilities to provide vivid detail of the psychological nature of non-traditional, minority characters. Generally, the authors do not withhold the intense emotions experienced by the characters; this graphic and realistic font provides us with an unbiased view of emotions that we thought were unique to our white culture. Love, passion, and hate are portrayed as emotions so powerful that they can drive entire cultures to unite, and at the same time, can torment even the lowest soul. This frankness and use of strong emotions provides us with a base on which we can reexamine our own feelings towards these emotions. Unlocking a hidden passion in a character can be as traumatic as a murder in our society, but this powerful emotion exudes strength and power in ethnic American literature. We are captivated by the characters' willingness to break out or release emotion because of the social norms placed on our white American society.

The cultural and emotional landscapes depicted in this literature present readers with diverse and nuanced experiences, allowing for a deeper exploration of the lives and struggles of ethnic characters. These characters serve as a powerful foil, enabling readers to modify, adapt, or reexamine their own beliefs and lifestyles.\n\nThe power of ethnic American literature lies in its authors\u2019 ability to vividly convey the psychological experiences of non-traditional, minority characters. Unlike the more reserved depictions in traditional literature, these authors do not shy away from portraying the intense and often raw emotions that these characters experience. This unflinching and realistic portrayal provides us with an unbiased view of emotions that we previously assumed were unique to our own culture. Love, passion, and hate are depicted in such vivid detail that they can drive entire communities to unite or tear them apart. This frankness and the use of strong emotions offer us a new perspective, allowing us to reexamine our own feelings and reactions.\n\nJust as unlocking a hidden passion can be traumatic in our society, in ethnic American literature, this powerful emotion exudes a sense of strength and resilience. These characters are often willing to break free from the social norms that restrict expression, capturing our attention and admiration. By experiencing these emotions through the eyes of ethnic American characters, we are able to find new meanings and ways to navigate our own emotional landscapes. This literature provides an escape from the social expectations that often stifle genuine expression, and through the experimentation of these characters, we can develop a more nuanced and empathetic understanding of our own feelings and the feelings of others.\n\nIn essence, ethnic American literature not only broadens our horizons but also challenges us to reevaluate our preconceptions and emotional responses, offering a rich and transformative reading experience.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

There was a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, that set guidelines for French literature. According to l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature.  However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.  \nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they did not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide \"kills\" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels. The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When Voltaire wrote Candide, the Neoclassic period was at its zenith, with French scholars under l'Academie Fran\u00e7aise setting strict guidelines for literature. According to the Academie, all works of the Neoclassic era must adhere to the rules of propriety, which dictated that authors avoid controversial topics such as sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another key standard was verisimilitude, requiring literature to be as realistic as possible, with settings, time, and plots grounded in everyday life. Voltaire, a Neoclassicist, was well-versed in these regulations and initially followed them in his works. However, in Candide, he deliberately defied the Academie's rules, creating a satirical masterpiece that parodies the Neoclassic style.\n\nNeoclassicists valued propriety and decorum, steering clear of controversial themes to maintain good manners. Yet, in Candide, Voltaire seemed to revel in stepping on toes\u2014indeed, he went beyond simply stepping on them, smacking them away. Voltaire's treatment of sex in Candide was particularly audacious. For instance, he described the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and the Baron who bathed with Musselmen and faced the consequence of a homosexual act. The narrative then escalated to violence when Cunegonde was raped by a barber, and Candide witnessed her attacker being murdered on top of her. Similarly, the wise old woman suffered the removal of a buttock by pirates and experienced rape, while the Baron was publicly whipped after his disgraceful act.\n\nMoreover, Voltaire's portrayal of these acts was surprisingly light-hearted. Cunegonde and the old woman recounted their experiences with the air of a vivid, yet entertaining tale during their conversations about their travels. The Baron continued his narrative with style even after his punishment. After Candide \"killed\" the Baron, he simply set off to find Cunegonde without much concern until he encountered the Baron again later. This casual treatment of sex and violence, juxtaposed with the Academie's strict guidelines, highlights the satirical nature of Voltaire's work in Candide, revealing the parody form in which he wrote.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

The statistics in South Carolina support Lunde's thesis.The majority of the murders in SC are committed by friends, relatives, neighbors, or someone the victim knew. The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around. For example, a guy may get mad at his brother and then pick up a gun in a threatening-type way. He may have no intention of using it. But, as Berkowitz states the <*>. In his aggressive rage, he may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to the death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years. Various races are becoming more and more acceptable. However, racial prejudice is seen today in medical research. Certain studies are carried out on people of one race. Therefore, the research results may not be correct for all people. It may be that the classification of people for studies needs to change. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, 90% of homicide victims and their murderers knew each other on a personal level, indicating a pre-existing relationship. This statistic is supported by data from South Carolina, where the majority of murders are committed by friends, relatives, or neighbors. These tragic incidents often stem from frustration and aggression, which can escalate into fatal outcomes, especially when guns are involved. For example, a heated argument between siblings can quickly turn deadly if a gun is present. As Berkowitz notes, \"the mere presence of a weapon can increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior,\" suggesting that in the heat of the moment, the killer may not intend to use the weapon but still might end up doing so.\n\nThe availability of guns also plays a significant role in these high-profile tragedies, turning what might have been a minor altercation into a fatal one. This accessibility can lead to unintentional deaths, such as children accidentally shooting each other. The presence of firearms can transform a seemingly trivial conflict into a deadly one, underscoring the dire consequences of easy access to weapons.\n\nRacial prejudice, though still present, has evolved into different forms over the years. One such form is aversive racism, where individuals avoid contact with certain minorities to suppress their negative feelings. Another emerging form is symbolic racism, where stereotypes are equated with broader social issues. For instance, many people believe that most welfare recipients are black, leading to perceptions of blacks as lazy and unwilling to work, despite the fact that most welfare recipients are actually white.\n\nAnother aspect of racial prejudice has also shifted and declined over the past three decades, with increasing acceptance of various races. However, this prejudice continues to manifest in medical research, where studies often focus on one specific racial group. This selective approach can lead to inaccurate generalizations that do not apply to all racial groups, highlighting the need for more inclusive and representative research methods.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy. I think that there is much more of this type of racism prelavent today, as well as the attitude of \"they\" are o.k. as long as they aren't around me because I'm not comfortable around them. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, approximately 90% of homicide victims knew or were acquainted with their killer. This statistic aligns with the findings from the SC report, which indicate that the majority of victims of homicide in SC were either family members, friends, or acquaintances. The underlying factors contributing to this phenomenon are largely rooted in the dynamics of frustration and aggression. Frustration, often stemming from a denial of a desired outcome, frequently leads to aggressive behavior, especially among individuals we know and regularly interact with. As a result, aggression is more likely to manifest towards those we are familiar with, leading to an increased likelihood of these individuals becoming victims of homicide.\n\nThe escalation of aggression in these situations is often described by the phrase \"the trigger pulls the finger,\" suggesting that once individuals find themselves in frustrating circumstances, their aggressive tendencies can quickly spiral out of control without premeditated intent. This can result in devastating outcomes, such as murder.\n\nRacial prejudice in contemporary society is generally less overt than it was 30 years ago. Due to the strong influence of conformity, prejudiced attitudes have become more subtle and concealed. People who hold such views may refrain from explicitly expressing them in social settings where dissent might be encountered, thus preventing open discrimination against minorities. Instead, these individuals may resort to symbolic forms of prejudice to express their racist views in a seemingly acceptable manner. Symbolic prejudice involves voicing negative opinions about something without clearly stating the underlying racial motivations. For instance, a white male who opposes welfare might claim it is due to laziness, while his true feelings are rooted in racial stereotypes about welfare recipients being predominantly black and lazy.\n\nToday, there appears to be a greater prevalence of such symbolic racism, as well as the attitude that \"they are okay as long as they aren't around me\" because the individual feels uncomfortable around them.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, an astounding 90% of homicides involve individuals who knew each other previously.

The ease of obtaining guns exacerbates this issue, as it's too simple to let aggressive feelings spiral out of control and result in fatal outcomes.\n\nPeople often become frustrated with those they love more frequently than with others, and these feelings can escalate into aggression. This aggression can easily spiral into lethal incidents, especially over minor frustrations. In South Carolina, this pattern is evident, with more homicides occurring around holidays such as Christmas and the Fourth of July. These times bring families together, providing ample opportunities for frustration and subsequent aggression.\n\nStatistics in South Carolina support these findings. Homicides are more common during holidays when family members gather. The most significant opportunities for frustration and subsequent aggression occur in these close-knit settings.\n\nRacial prejudice, though less openly accepted today than 30 years ago, still plays a role in attitudes and behaviors. In the past, it was more common for people to openly express their prejudices without attempting to hide or justify them. Today, individuals face greater pressure to explain their prejudiced actions not only to others but to themselves as well. \n\nFor instance, a study revealed that students were equally likely to help both black and white students who had demonstrated effort.

The statistics from SC do support the thesis, but not at the 90%, it is closer to about 75-80%. It is still a fact that if we kill someone it will most likely by someone we know simply because these are the people we are in contact with every day. In many cases the finger is not pulling the trigger, rather the trigger pulls the finger. Domestic disputes often en in tragedy, but only because one person doesn't think the other will actually shoot them, likewise the person with the gun really doesn't want to kill the other, only even the scales. But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger. If the gun had not been present, it may have ended in a fistfight, or simply in one of the brothers being upset.\nRacial prejudice still exists today, the only real difference is that it is not as open as it was in the sixties. It is hard for me, a white middle class male, to say what prejudice is like for minorities today as opposed to 30 years ago. I know that there has been a lot of progress in terms of segregation and discrimination, but it really couldn't have gotten much worse that it had been. Maybe by the turn of the decade we will all be Americans, or just people and not labeled by others as white or black or whatever. This would be ideal, but as long as people are different there will be those who judge solely on skin color, hair length, gender, and who knows maybe even shoe size.\nPrejudice still exists, but thankfully it is known as ignorance to many people, whereas 30 years ago it was thought to be \"just the way it is\". No longer is \"separate but equal\" accepted and that in itself is a huge step for reducing prejudice.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The percentage of people who are killed by those they know or are related to is around 90%, according to the statistics from SC. While the exact figure may vary, this still underscores a crucial fact: if we kill someone, it is most likely to be someone we know. This is because we are in constant contact with these individuals, making it more probable for conflicts to escalate into tragedy.\n\nDomestic disputes often culminate in tragedy, but not necessarily because the intentions are malicious. In many cases, the person with the firearm does not intend to kill; they merely want the other to stop their unwarranted actions. However, the presence of a weapon can tip the scales, leading to actions that would not have occurred otherwise. For instance, consider two brothers in an argument, one of whom insults the other. A gun is introduced, and the brother with the gun only wants the other to cease his harassment. Yet, the presence of the gun can cause the finger to pull the trigger, transforming a verbal altercation into a deadly confrontation. Had no weapon been present, the dispute might have remained a physical altercation or simply resulted in feelings of resentment.\n\nRacial prejudice persists today, though it is not as openly displayed as it was in the 1960s. As a white middle-class male, it is challenging for me to fully comprehend the experiences of minorities in today's society compared to three decades ago. While significant progress has been made in terms of segregation and discrimination, prejudice cannot become worse than it already was. Perhaps by the turn of the decade, we may all be considered simply \"Americans\" rather than labeled by our race, ethnicity, or other superficial traits. Although ideal, this scenario is more a hopeful vision than a realistic prediction. As long as people are different, there will be those who judge others based on their skin color, hair length, gender, and other characteristics.\n\nPrejudice still exists, but the perception of it has shifted. Today, many recognize prejudice as ignorance rather than an accepted norm. Thirty years ago, \"separate but equal\" was widely accepted, which significantly contributed to prejudice. The rejection of this notion represents a substantial step forward in reducing prejudice. As society continues to evolve, the hope is that ignorance will eventually give way to understanding and acceptance.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

These tragedies illustrate the power of frustration on the human body. People who murder others probably didn't go into the situation wanting to murder the other. The person's frustration led to anger and aggression that just got out of control. Even small things such as getting in the way of someone's goal can lead to the frustration which leads to aggressive act of murder. These tragedies also illustrate the flippancy with which we Americans view murder and other forms of violence. Through exposure, perhaps we have been desensitized to violence. The media also plays a part in this flippancy. When a character is shot, he often appears in the next scene. Kids, in particular, aren't forming realistic schemas regarding violence. The media also desensitizes men to sex crimes leading to more rapes. We as potential parents must instill in our children - the future presidents, doctors, teachers, & even murders - a true picture of aggression & the need to control it.\nRacial prejudice is not as pronounced as it was 30 years ago. It is actually appearing to decline. This is evidenced in, for example, cartoons and t.v. shows - racial minorities are not publicly stereotyped.

For instance, even small obstacles can trigger intense frustration, leading to anger and aggression that spiral out of control. The person involved likely did not intend to commit murder; instead, their frustration reached a critical point, resulting in an impulsive act of violence.\n\nThese tragic incidents also illustrate the desensitization of American society to violence, a phenomenon exacerbated by pervasive media exposure. The media's portrayal of violence often depicts it as a routine occurrence, without the gravity it should carry. Exposure to such content can desensitize individuals, including children, who are not forming realistic schemas of violence. For example, when characters are shot in media, they are frequently shown in subsequent scenes, reinforcing the normalcy of violence in the public's mind. This desensitization can also affect attitudes toward sexual violence, as the media may normalize sexual misconduct, leading to an increase in rape.\n\nFurthermore, as potential parents, we must instill in our children, who will grow up to be future leaders in various fields, a clear understanding of the importance of controlling aggression. This awareness is crucial, whether the child grows up to be a president, a doctor, a teacher, or a member of society who may commit a violent act.\n\nInterestingly, while racial prejudice has declined in some respects, as evidenced by the more diverse representation in cartoons and television shows, racial stereotypes remain a significant issue. However, attitudes toward desegregation and racial integration have indeed softened.

This is due to the fact that human beings tend to become frustrated with those whom they like and love. When we encounter a stranger, we generally do not care enough about him to allow frustration to develop. However, since frustration leads to aggression, and we normally become frustrated with those whom we like and love, human beings have a higher tendency for inflicting aggressive behavior on our loved ones.\nFifty years ago, when segregation was enacted, this led to stereotyping and prejudice. Because <*> were separated, this caused tremendous outgroup bias, leading to deep-rooted beliefs that black southern americans are inferior. Desegregation, shortly thereafter, raised prejudiced attitudes because of competition, and the fundamental attribution theory. <*> in classroom situations, for example, the white and black students lived in different social status, causing black students to feel intimidated about answering questions and speaking in class. The timidness of blacks in the classroom, caused other students to see these blacks as \"stupid\", thus, lowering the self esteem of the black student because of self-fulfilled prophecy. Low self-esteem only led to more shyness, and for the white students to further believe the stereotype: the black student is \"stupid\", because he does not speak in class.\nAlso, economic competition leads to prejudice, because the white men believed they were superior, even after desegregation. The problem lay with unequal status situation, where the whites could not relate to the blacks social situation. Racial prejudice has developed a trend for thirty years, as people continue to conform to prejudice, beliefs and attitudes. However, in public housing situations, for example, where there is an equal status situation, prejudice is greatly reduced.

The problem lay in the unequal status situations, where whites could not fully empathize with the social and economic challenges faced by blacks. Over the past three decades, racial prejudice has developed as people continue to conform to these beliefs and attitudes. However, in equal-status situations, such as in public housing, prejudice is significantly reduced. To further reduce prejudice in the South, it is hoped that more programs can be implemented to create and maintain equal-status environments.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

It is, no doubt, a fast way of commuting to and from destinations with little stress on the body, however traffic congestion is becoming a major concern in any city or town. It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it was before. Lancaster is a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.\nAlong with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared to give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common in the major American cities and even, at times, London.\nWith such are large no. of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. \u00a3 billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in as best a condition as possible.\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with he number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress which can again be due to traffic congestion.\nAll of these problems, one way or another, can all be linked with congestion and hence the number of cars on the road. To attempt to lessen this number, I have a number of solutions.\n1. Park and Ride - have cars outside of town and catch a free/cheap bus into town.\n2. Improvent of public transport - Cheaper fares, cleaner, more pleasant environment to encourage them to leave their cars at home.\n3.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The problems facing road transport are numerous with potentially severe penalties. Today, the vast majority of UK families own a car, making it an indispensable mode of transportation. While it undoubtedly offers a fast and stress-free commute to destinations, traffic congestion has emerged as a significant concern in towns and cities. Efforts to alleviate this issue through the construction of additional roads have proven ineffective, as the number of cars continually increases, perpetuating the same congestion. Lancaster, for instance, is a clear example of a failed one-way system, with walking often proving faster during peak hours (e.g., 08:00 and 17:00). This failure led to the introduction of a bypass, which, despite its intentions, is seldom utilized, further highlighting the challenges faced by car-dependent cities.\n\nAlong with congestion, pollution poses a substantial threat. The greenhouse effect, a major concern for most citizens, remains a pressing issue despite the limited willingness to abandon personal vehicles. The government has responded by addressing this issue, with car manufacturers now incorporating catalytic converters in newer models to reduce emissions. Visible examples of air pollution, such as smog in cities like Mexico City and major American cities, as well as occasional occurrences in London, underscore the severity of this problem.\n\nGiven the massive number of cars on the roads, maintenance also presents a significant challenge. The government spends billions of pounds annually to maintain the UK's road network in the best possible condition. Additionally, the alarming increase in the number of accidents, directly linked to the proliferation of cars and road stress, further exacerbates the issue.\n\nThese problems, in one form or another, can be traced back to congestion and the sheer number of cars on the road.

This is putting increasing stress on our road network, especially along major commercial routes, such as Birmingham to London, and in town centres where the streets and roads were not designed for such a large number of cars. This large no. of cars is causing congestion and general \"wear and tear\" of our roads.\nThe easy access to cars has enabled people to move out of the polluted, \"grey\" cities and into out-of-town villages where they can commute. This has meant that whereas people used to walk or catch a bus to work they now drive into work. This is especially true in the major cities such as London and Birmingham and this can be seen in the horrific traffic problems which plague these cities. When faced with large traffic jams there is the tendancy to find shortcuts and this can lead to heavy traffic through rural villages or residential areas. The number of heavy goods vehicles on the road networks has also increased and frequent lorry traffic can damage roads not built for this purpose quickly. They also restrict the flow of traffic on motorways especially when in large numbers.\nThe rail transport in the United Kingdom also has many problems. One of these is the increasing number of people who prefer to drive rather than catch a train. This unpopularity has come about especially over shorter distances due to the delays and strike problems etc.\nThe privatisation and sell off of many of the more profitable networks such as the South East has lead to a profit-base operation meaning fewer trains, higher fares and the closure of many of the smaller stations.\nAnother problem is the unwillingness of industry to transport goods by train often due to the limited rail network and the cost compared to transport by HGV's.\nThe opening of the Eurotunnel, connecting the UK network to the rest of Europe, it is hoped, will stimulate the rail industry but a number of problems and Eurotunnel's increasing debt has done little to convince the general public.\nThere are many possible solutions to the problems I have identified many of which would compliment each other. Firstly the problem of traffic congestion of our roads could be mainly tackled in two ways.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The number of cars in the United Kingdom has significantly increased since the mass motorway building schemes of the 1970s, placing immense pressure on our road network, particularly along major commercial routes such as Birmingham to London and in town centres that were not originally designed to accommodate such a large volume of vehicles. The influx of cars is causing congestion and widespread wear and tear on our roads, leading to deteriorating infrastructure and increased travel times.\n\nOne significant consequence of easy access to cars is the trend of people relocating from polluted, \"grey\" cities to out-of-town villages, where they can commute by car. This shift means that many individuals who previously walked or took buses to work now drive, especially in major cities like London and Birmingham. Consequently, these areas are grappling with severe traffic problems. In response to congestion, some drivers seek alternative routes, which can result in heavy traffic through rural villages and residential areas. Furthermore, the rise in the number of heavy goods vehicles has exacerbated the issue, as roads not built for this purpose suffer rapid deterioration and restrict the flow of traffic on motorways, particularly when these vehicles are in large numbers.\n\nThe rail transport system in the United Kingdom also faces numerous challenges. Increasingly, more people prefer driving over taking a train, particularly for shorter distances, due to delays, strikes, and other issues. This trend is exacerbated by the privatization and sell-off of many profitable networks, such as those in the South East, which have led to a focus on profit-making rather than passenger service improvements. This has resulted in fewer trains, higher fares, and the closure of many smaller stations. Moreover, industry's reluctance to transport goods by rail is partly due to the limited rail network and higher costs compared to HGVs.\n\nThe opening of the Eurotunnel, which connects the UK network to the rest of Europe, was intended to revitalize the rail industry. However, the tunnel's financial struggles and increasing debt have not sufficiently bolstered public confidence in the sector.\n\nAddressing these problems requires multifaceted solutions. Primarily, traffic congestion on our roads can be mitigated through two key approaches. Firstly, improving public transportation systems to make them more attractive and efficient can reduce the number of cars on the road. This includes increasing the frequency and reliability of trains and buses, as well as expanding the rail network to cover more areas. Secondly, implementing congestion pricing and expanding infrastructure to handle the increasing number of vehicles can also alleviate traffic congestion.

Public transport is underfunded; the roads are croweded and almost unbearable near cities + even smaller towns nowadays.\nIf you're ever in a traffic queue then look around, look at the occupants of cars. Well over 3/4 of them will be alone. Surely this means something? OK so this is the solitary age of the 90's, + people don't want to trust anyone or anything else but the greater reason is the abysmal public transport we have at this time. Over priced, shoddy surroundings, poor service and more often than not, late. If public transport was just a little bit more accomadating than it is then many people would consider using it rather than their own private 'tank'.\nA root cause for these problems is the endless privatisation of anything and everything by this government. They feed endless diatribes onto the people who are too lethargic to care. They say that privatisation will lead to better service and prices. However the advent of many, separate profit making companies running the roads and track cant be good for the consumer in the long term. The government is effectively handing out monopolies to companies just to try and balance their short term interests.\nAlso the means of transportation hasn't changed greatly in the past 10 years whilst the volume of traffic has increased threefold in the case of the roadsystem. Obviously more roads are needed. However there is a limit. Nobody wants a concrete jungle for a country. There is though an optimum balance which I believe has not yet been reached. It is when bypasses of bypasses are being built that the country will reach saturation levels. To be fair the authority's are in a no win situation here. If they don't build more roads then people complain about the density of traffic and if they do then rabid enviromentalists spring out form their undergrouth and start chaining themselves to trees! Just look at the case of the planned Newbury bypass. Already it is behind schedule due to the ranting of these 'enviromentalists'.

While the 1990s are known as the \"solitary age,\" the primary reason for this trend is the poor quality of public transport. Overpriced, shoddy surroundings, and unreliable services often make public transport a less appealing option than driving a private vehicle, which is essentially an expensive tank.\n\nA key root cause of these issues is the endless privatization of everything by the government. They tout that privatization will lead to better service and prices, but the reality is that having many separate profit-making companies running the roads and tracks may not be in the best interest of consumers in the long term.

Clearly, more roads are needed, but there is a limit to how much concrete can be poured without turning the country into a concrete jungle. An optimum balance has yet to be reached. When bypasses of bypasses are being built, it signifies that the country has likely reached saturation levels. The authorities are indeed in a no-win situation; if they don't build more roads, people complain about traffic density, and if they do, environmentalists protest by chaining themselves to trees.\n\nTake the planned Newbury bypass as a prime example.

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'.

Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person.

It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to \"fill in the gaps\". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors. We are simply running out of room to build new roads.\nOne of the main side effects of road travel in particular is pollution. Acid rain, asthma and many other problems are rife and soon the fuels for these cars will be running out. Gas buses and gars is really only a short term solution and a renewable source must be found. But with petrol companies unwilling to investigate water and alcohol powered cars for fear of losing petrol sales these still seem a long way off as our everyday form of transport.\nSolutions for these problems in Britain have been fairly unimaginative and unsuccessful.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The United Kingdom, despite its small size and a population of around 55 million, faces significant challenges due to its inadequate and expensive public transport system.

The essay will have four sections too it. Firstly the main problems of road transport will be identified and this shall be followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate. \nRoad transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room. Away from cities road construction faces the problem of geographical sites.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Before any essay can be started, the key words in the essay title must be defined and understood. \"Main Problems\" are those which worry road and rail transport operators to the extent that they are significant enough to put them off. The essay will have four sections: first, the main problems of road transport will be identified and followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be applied to rail transport, ensuring that the arguments remain separate as their issues are largely distinct.\n\nRoad transport encompasses a wide range of vehicles, from bicycles to coaches, all designed to transport passengers to their destinations. The primary challenge facing road transport is congestion, which has become increasingly prevalent. This congestion is due to two primary factors. Firstly, there is a continual increase in the number of cars on the roads. Secondly, the road systems developed in the past did not anticipate the extent of congestion we currently face. Many cities have implemented one-way systems, which, if planned more effectively, might alleviate some of the current traffic issues. The extent of the problem is clear: too many vehicles are attempting to use the same routes simultaneously. \"Traffic jams\" are particularly severe during rush hours on 'A' roads leading into city centers, between 7:00 AM and 9:30 AM, and again from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. These roads are relatively empty at night, highlighting the peak times during which congestion is most pronounced. Similarly, motorways are consistently congested during holiday seasons due to increased traffic.\n\nThe second major problem is the difficulty in constructing new roads. There are numerous obstacles to building new infrastructure. Environmentalists and local residents often protest against the construction of bypasses, such as the proposed Dwyford Downs, leading to significant delays and opposition. This is not a significant issue in all cases, but it poses a substantial challenge in city centers where there is simply insufficient space to build new roads. Outside urban areas, road construction is further hampered by geographical constraints, such as challenging terrain and existing infrastructure.\n\nIn contrast, rail transport faces its own set of issues, which will be explored in the subsequent sections of the essay to maintain a clear distinction from road transport problems.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are numerous challenges facing both road and rail transport in the UK, with congestion and safety being the most frequently discussed issues for roads. Around major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester, and Birmingham, congestion is particularly pronounced. The straightforward solution\u2014building more roads or expanding existing ones\u2014has encountered significant resistance from environmental groups and local residents, as exemplified by recent opposition in Newbury. Instead, reducing congestion in large cities could be achieved by persuading people to avoid personal vehicles. Introducing schemes like the \"park-and-ride\" initiative and encouraging the use of bicycles could significantly decrease the number of cars on the roads.\n\nSafety on the roads is also a critical concern, with accidents often attributed to dangerous driving on busy roads. To address this, various measures could be implemented. While the recent increase in the legal limit for drinking and driving might seem counterintuitive, lowering it further and significantly could deter many drivers from using their vehicles and instead encourage the use of public transport. Increasing law enforcement by giving the police more arrest powers and boosting the number of speed cameras, along with potentially imposing larger fines, could also have a deterrent effect. Additionally, reducing the national speed limit might encourage drivers to be more cautious and thus improve road safety.\n\nRail transport faces a different set of challenges, with efficiency being the primary concern. Trains are frequently delayed, leading to a decrease in customer satisfaction. Many passengers are opting for other modes of transport, such as cars for shorter distances and planes for longer journeys. This inefficiency is largely due to outdated and slower trains compared to more modern systems, such as the French TGV or the Japanese \"bullet\" train. To enhance rail efficiency, upgrading the current rolling stock to match modern standards would be a crucial step.\n\nIn conclusion, while road transport struggles with congestion and safety, rail transport faces issues primarily related to efficiency. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including both structural improvements and regulatory changes, to enhance both the convenience and reliability of these essential transportation modes.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

Space for such projects is greatly limited due to green-belt restrictions and local opposition. Such a scheme would produce vast quantities of pollution and noise. there is no clear-cut way to overcome these problems, eve though literally millions of pounds has been invested by companies such as Tarmat.\nOn many roads, Sound Baffles have been erected to combat noise by absorbing the carrier waves. these, however, have only a limited affect. \nA way around these problems is, however, in sight. Road transport will be greatly improved if it is the cars themselves which become quieter, more efficient, and less harmful to the general environment. Many cars have come onto the market which claim to be all these things and more, but they never seem to take off. The perfect solution would be electric vehicles which would overcome all the aforementioned hurdles. The only problem is their range and speed. They can only go about fifty miles per hour as a maximum, and require recharging every 100 miles; which in itself can take nearly six hours!\nDevelopments are taking place for faster and more efficient electric cars, but before they can be seen on British roads, we will have to wait well into the next century.\nRailways have developed too, recently. All the problems facing railways at the moment are financial and not geographic. There is not the widespread interest in rail travel which there once was. More and more people are opting to travel by car these days, and so there is not as much economical input. Closure of lines due to under-usage is now quite common, the costs of maintenance and running costs exceed the income from users. \nThere is a way around these problems, but it is very expensive. A huge advertising campaign explaining how much cheaper rail travel is when compared to other modes of transport would eventually get through.\nNew trains are also in development, and once again they run off electricity.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "As time progresses, road and rail travel will increasingly dominate future transportation, each facing distinct challenges and solutions.\n\nRoads have significantly expanded in both size and number, with recent developments like the \"super-motorway,\" a proposed five or six-lane route connecting Birmingham to the M25. However, space constraints, particularly green-belt restrictions and local opposition, limit further expansion. These projects also raise environmental concerns, producing significant pollution and noise. Despite substantial investments from companies like Tarmat, no clear solution has emerged to address these issues.\n\nTo mitigate noise pollution, sound baffles have been installed on many roads, absorbing carrier waves. However, these measures only provide limited relief. A more promising approach would be to improve the inherent quietness and efficiency of cars themselves. While some vehicles claim to be quieter, more efficient, and environmentally friendly, these innovations often fail to gain widespread adoption. Electric vehicles represent an ideal solution, as they can eliminate many of the aforementioned issues. Unfortunately, their current limitations\u2014such as a maximum speed of about 50 miles per hour and needing 6 hours to recharge every 100 miles\u2014hamper their practicality. Although advancements are being made, significant improvements to range and speed will not likely be realized for several decades.\n\nConcurrently, railways have also seen development, though they currently face financial challenges. The lack of widespread interest in rail travel and the increasing preference for road transport have led to reduced economic investment. Consequently, the closure of underutilized lines is becoming more common, as maintenance and operating costs exceed user revenue. While a comprehensive advertising campaign highlighting the cost-effectiveness of rail travel could potentially boost interest, it would be an expensive endeavor. Additionally, new electric train models are in development, promising further advancements in the future.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six. The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "On Britain's roads, there is an ever-increasing volume of traffic, overwhelming the road network and leading to frequent hold-ups and traffic jams.

Yet, people are not embracing the rail system due to its lack of integration, particularly following recent privatization of various areas. Different companies often charge different fares for the same route, making it confusing and sometimes prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe main disadvantage of the railways is the disjointed service provided by companies that are not coordinated, leading to the inconvenience of having to switch between bus and train services without an integrated timetable.

This integration would eliminate the need for long walks, waiting for buses, or expensive taxi rides.\n\nMy solution to this problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, thereby encouraging more people to leave the roads and use public transport.

This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish, and can travel \"door-to-door\" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years, due to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.\nI think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport. The government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements, such as the widening of motorways. This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport, with more services on the timetables, lower rates and less delays. These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid pace, the roads will be completely congested.

Today's population desires more freedom and has more disposable income, both contributing to an increase in car ownership. Moreover, many individuals feel unsafe walking or using public transport, with mothers, who once walked their children to school, now preferring to drive them, driven by fears of child abductors, as evidenced by high-profile cases like the James Bulger and Fred and Mary West cases. These incidents have heightened public awareness and concern. Additionally, cars are more convenient, allowing travel at any time and providing \"door-to-door\" service, whereas buses and trains require walking to stations. The high levels of vehicles on the roads have also made cycling increasingly dangerous and polluting, deterring many people from using bicycles as a mode of transportation.\n\nAs a result, rail travel has experienced a decline in popularity, with cars now being the preferred mode of transport. While some people avoid trains due to perceived unreliability, the lack of flexible timetables is another significant factor. Buses and trains cannot offer the same freedom of choice as cars, as passengers are tied to the schedules and locations of railway stations.\n\nTo address these issues, I believe the government should prioritize improving public transport to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. This can be achieved by increasing investment in buses, trains, and other forms of public transport rather than focusing solely on road improvements, such as widening motorways. By investing more funds into public transport, services can become more attractive, with more frequent schedules, lower fares, and fewer delays. Such measures may encourage a shift from car usage to public transport, particularly for commuting to work or school.", "speed": 0.45175317598090764, "eta": "00h04m45s"}

This is in my opinion, shows considerable ignorance. \nI am by far and away no 'greeny' who wants to make everyone live in tipee's and eat soya bean soup, however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today.\nThe governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move, they are not even attempting to treat the cause, thent more and more people are now driving.\nWe all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road. Why? \nDo we, the westeren world (5% of the population of the world), have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost? Just beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport. Even if we did, then shorly so does the rest of the world. That could have disasterous  implications. \nThe 2nd reason, is the promblem that the public transport service, for example rail, is declining so much, there is no train to catch in the morning. People stopped using trains because of the fall in standards, these people were forced onto the road, routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back, forcing more people onto the roads. The whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use.\nThis has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways, to privite rail companys, profit motivated.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world's population.

There has not be whole sale reform of the electral system within Britain since women were granted the vote in the 1920's. This only alowed a growth in the electorate with the system of voting not having changed since the last century. This above all else can be seen to make Britain an undemocratic country.\nThe system used within Britain is known as the \"First past the post\" system. This is the system of direct constituencies. within these constiuencies the candidate with the largest number of votes is elected. This means that in many areas candidates are elected with under 50% of the total vote within that constituency. These successful candidate move on to the House of Commons to become MPs. This creates a house of representatives voted in by a minority vote in many cases (the only exceptions being for instance Huntington or Islington two very safe seats). This led the times when at a general election when parties have come to power with less votes than the main opposition party. This was the case in 1970 with the Conservative victory under Edward Heath. Many would argue that the weaknesses and unfairness of this system are apparent and that it should be changed. However there are strengths to this system. The first past the post system always leads to strong government usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the conservatives in the early 1960's was done through the first past the post system; The other option is proportional representation which is seen to give more say to the electorate on who get elected. But unfortunatly this system can lead to weak government allowing the growth of political extremist parties, through the ability to have a member of Parliament even with the overall vote. Also weak government, especially within Britains 3 party system where the balance of power would always be held by the Liberal Democrats and the National Parties. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Although Britain is often hailed as having one of the oldest democracies in the world, many aspects of its electoral system can be seen as outdated, old-fashioned, and fundamentally unfair. Since the mid-20th century, there has been no comprehensive overhaul of the electoral system, with the introduction of women's voting rights in the 1920s being the last significant reform. This failure to adapt has led to a system where the electorate has grown without the voting mechanism being updated since the last century, making Britain's democracy appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe \"first-past-the-post\" system, which is the cornerstone of Britain's electoral process, involves direct constituencies where the candidate with the most votes wins. This system often results in candidates being elected with less than 50% of the total vote within their constituencies. Consequently, the House of Commons is dominated by MPs elected by a minority of votes in many cases, a scenario exemplified by the 1970 general election when the Conservative Party, under Edward Heath, won with less than the main opposition Labour Party's total vote. While this system frequently produces strong and stable governments, it is often criticized for being undemocratic and for allowing parties to gain power with a smaller share of the overall vote.\n\nHowever, the first-past-the-post system also has its strengths. It consistently produces a clear and decisive government with a majority, which facilitates effective governance. For instance, the conservative government's efforts in the early 1960s to modernize Britain's economy were significantly aided by this system. Critics argue that proportional representation, a more modern system that allocates seats based on the total votes received, would offer the electorate a more accurate reflection of their preferences. Proportional representation could indeed lead to a more representative parliament, but it also poses risks. This system could result in weak governments, potentially allowing extremist parties to gain representation. Additionally, it could create a multi-party system where the balance of power is held by smaller parties, leading to political instability and compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the \"first-past-the-post\" system remains a cornerstone of British democracy, its inherent flaws necessitate a reevaluation and potential reform to ensure that the nation's democratic processes remain relevant and fair.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.\nIt is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls at the first hurdle. With this system any madman can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.\nThere is no fair and perfect way to run a country. One please some people some of the time, but not all people all of the time. The only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most, and even then people are discontent.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The British parliamentary electoral system is often criticized as unfair and undemocratic.

This outcome undermines democratic principles because it does not reflect the true will of the majority.\n\nMoreover, the system relies on the idea that each constituency has an MP who champions the interests of that particular area within parliament. While this concept has its merits, it also has significant flaws. For instance, consider the recent case of an MP who decided to switch parties. It is often argued that constituents should vote based on the MP\u2019s beliefs, but in reality, many voters base their decisions on how well a party is performing at the time of the election. Once in power, the government is free to implement policies without significant constraints, often leading to hollow promises for the next election, which then become further entangled in political games.\n\nYet, despite its imperfections, the British parliamentary system stands out as the best option. Dictatorships, for instance, clearly fail this test. In a parliamentary system, a single individual or group cannot control the country, nor can they cause widespread economic disasters. It is a more stable and accountable framework.\n\nWhile no system is perfect, achieving a fair and ideal system of government is challenging. Even in smaller groups, where decisions are made by a handful of people, discontent often persists.

Examples of 'bloodsports' are stag hunting, bullfighting, pheasant shooting and even fishing. Fox hunting is immoral and unnecessary. \nThe uniform of a fox hunter usually consists of a scarlet jacket, white 'jogpets', white shirt, black tie and polished black riding boots. From a distance this would seem to be the uniform of some kind of a gentleman. The fox hunt is a lengthy and extreemly cruel process. The riders all gather together in what is called 'the meet'. This can last anywhere from 20 minutes up to 90 minutes and basically this is where all the riders admire each other's uniforms and wait for the dogs to pick up a scent.\nWhen the dogs finally find a scent the hunt begins. The dogs take the lead, once again there can be a number of anywhere between 20 and 100 dogs. The riders follow on. If we can possibly imagine what this poor fox is going through as it 'runs for its life' literally. If the fox happens to stray from the woodlands onto other farmers' property, across roads and fields - the dogs follow. This can cause immense damage to the countryside in the form of knocked-down walls, gates, trampled hedges and huge 'hoof' marks throughout the area.\nWhen the dogs finally catch up with the fox, it is literally ripped to pieces, limb from limb. The riders rarely actually get to see the fox, once it has been caught.\nHowever, on the other side of the argument the farmers say foxes are a pest and have to be controlled some way or another. The foxes kill sheep, hens and scare animals and so the farmers feel they have every right to kill these pests. The farmers also say the 'hunt' is very exciting and is a major part of their lives. The 'thrill of the chase' has no substitutes.\nNow that we have seen both sides to this argument solutions should be discussed. For example, foxes could be controlled in some other way, an example could be a shotgun. A bullet to the head is a much more  moral way to kill this animal than to literally rip it to shreads. The farmers will then complain that they have nothing to do on a Sunday. This is where 'drag hunting' becomes involved.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Fox hunting, a practice considered by many as a 'bloodsport,' should be banned, as it is both immoral and unnecessary.

For instance, a fox hunter\u2019s uniform\u2014a scarlet jacket, white 'jogpets,' a white shirt, a black tie, and polished black riding boots\u2014may appear elegant, but it conceals the inhumane treatment of animals.

Ultimately, the fox is ripped apart limb by limb, with riders often not witnessing the final act. \n\nOn the other hand, farmers argue that foxes are pests, killing sheep, hens, and other livestock, which justifies the need to control their population. Additionally, they claim the hunts are a thrilling and integral part of their lives, with the 'thrill of the chase' being irreplaceable. However, solutions to this conflict exist. Foxes could be controlled using more humane methods, such as a shotgun, where a bullet to the head is a more moral alternative to the brutal mutilation. \n\nMoreover, farmers can maintain their traditions through 'drag hunting,' where a decoy scent is used to simulate the hunt, providing a thrilling experience without the cruelty. This approach not only addresses ethical concerns but also preserves the cultural significance of the hunt for farmers.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

My reasons for this are as follows.\nFox hunting in my eyes is a brutal sport carried out by the higher classes in society. It is regarded by many people as being traditional and indeed the practice of fox hunting has been carried out for many years. However I regard fox hunting as a pointless and futile sport. In many ways it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have be necessary to cull the numbers of foxes but now foxes have become so rare that they are rarely seen in the wild.\nFoxes are simply hunted for fun and for trohpy's. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests and occasionaly foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats but now public opinion has put this to an end. \nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population. The foxes are not really given a chance. Once one is spotted by the hunting party a pack of hounds is sent after it. All the fox can do is flee in desparation. It does not really stand a chance against the overwhelming odds of about twenty blood thirsty hounds.

Despite its long-standing tradition, which many people regard as essential, I see it as a pointless and futile activity. Historically, fox hunting may have been necessary to control fox populations, but with foxes now becoming increasingly rare and rarely seen in the wild, the practice seems outdated.\n\nFoxes are primarily hunted for fun and trophies, not for subsistence. While many farmers view foxes as pests, causing occasional damage to their farms by killing chickens or other birds, this is simply part of their natural behavior. Foxes must eat to survive and provide for their offspring. As a result, most farmers permit fox hunting on their land. Although foxes may occasionally harm farm animals, this is more a matter of instinct than malice. In my opinion, there is no justification for killing a rare and timid animal simply for sport.\n\nI regard fox hunting as a pointless and brutal activity. The involvement of pomp and ceremony only adds to its futility. Moreover, the hunt is excessively brutal for the endangered fox population.

In today's society it is an outdated and barbaric \"sport\" which, in my opinion, should be banned. \nIn this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare. Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals, which are going to be slaughtered, should be transported. These measures include the time the animals spend on the road, how much room they have etc. etc. However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs. This, apparantly, is a sport.\nThe Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes. Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government. It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators. At least if one dog fights another the fight is, in some, fair. But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others. The fox stands no chance, why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned.\nFox hunting is, for the most part, enjoyed by the upper-class. It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse, dogs and riding equipment (eg. helmet, boots etc.) you also need land to do it in. It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox-hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class, wealthy supporters who fox hunt.\nIn a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox. The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries (eg. when banning whaling) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals (eg. the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "An issue that is increasingly debated is whether fox hunting should be banned.

While animal rights have been a topic of discussion in Parliament and measures have been implemented to enhance animal welfare, such as the recent legislation on how animals are transported for slaughter, fox hunting remains legal. This practice, where a group chases a fox with a pack of dogs until it is exhausted and torn apart, is perplexing given the government's stance on other blood sports.\n\nFor instance, it is illegal for dogs to attack badgers, yet dogs can still attack foxes. Similarly, it is illegal for two dogs to fight for the enjoyment of spectators, whereas an infinite number of dogs can attack a single fox for entertainment. These inconsistencies highlight a perceived unfairness and hypocrisy in the government's approach to animal welfare. The fact that fox hunting is legal while other blood sports are banned raises ethical questions and suggests that foxes are not afforded the same level of protection as other animals.\n\nFurther, fox hunting is predominantly enjoyed by the upper class, who can afford the high cost of participating in the activity, which includes owning a horse, dogs, and the necessary riding equipment. Additionally, they need access to land to practice. Given this, it is my belief that the Conservative government would not ban fox hunting due to the support and funding it receives from its wealthy, upper-class constituents.\n\nIn a nation that boasts very few surviving wild animals, it is essential to consider the impact of such practices on our remaining wildlife. While Britain is often proactive in supporting the protection of wild animals in other countries, it appears less eager to protect its own fox population. This double standard is particularly troubling, as the government frequently criticizes countries for destroying habitats, yet allows practices that contribute to the decline of our local wildlife.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the time has come for a reevaluation of the legal status of fox hunting.

In the modern world there is no need to hunt in order to obtain our food.\nThis raises the moral issue, 'is it right and just to kill animals if we aren't going to eat them'? Are blood sports acceptable in todays society?\nThen again, should foxhunting be classed as a sport. The fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers as it is a carniverous predator and will eat the farmers smaller livestock. Therefore foxhunting has the purpose of a modern day 'pest control company' whose role is to exterminate rodents and pests. There are however organised leisure fox hunts for fun and I am sure that the participants enjoy themselves immensely. No doubt most of the fun is had in the chase and not the kill. Therefore perhaps like fishermen (leisure), the prey could be caught and then released. Unfortunately the hounds won't see it this way!\nThe pursuit of fox hunting comes under a lot of attack from pressure groups. Protests are all very well but the protesters have taken it too far recently. In the 1st week of the New Year a man and his wife were beaten up severely by a gang of protestors in front of their two young children. by doing this the protestors are taking the law into their own hands and whats more are violating the very laws of inhumanity which they so ardently stick up for.\nBy banning fox hunting the law would probably drive the sport 'underground' as it were and the participants would find some way around it. The sport will and probably always has been under attack from protestors but strong public opinion against blood sports doesn't give them the right to fight back literally. There is a strong argument that fox hunting is a national institution and a tradition which should be continued. However, I don't think that it will be banned and all that can be done is to have policemen on site to ensure that during a hunt the fox is the only animal that gets killed!\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Since the beginning of man on this earth, hunting has been a fundamental aspect of survival, a practice that has evolved over millennia. In the modern world, however, the necessity of hunting for sustenance has largely been obsolete. This raises the moral question, \"Is it right and just to kill animals if we aren't going to eat them?\" This query extends to whether blood sports, such as foxhunting, are acceptable in today\u2019s society.\n\nFoxhunting, for instance, raises the question of whether it should be categorized as a sport. While a fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers due to its predatory habits and consumption of smaller livestock, foxhunting can be seen as a modern-day pest control service. On the other hand, organized leisure fox hunts serve primarily for enjoyment, with the chase being the primary source of pleasure for participants. It could be argued that like angling for leisure, fox could be caught and released. However, the hounds involved in the hunt would not see this as a reasonable solution.\n\nFox hunting is frequently subjected to criticism from pressure groups, and while demonstrations are a form of protest, the recent escalation to violence, such as the severe beating of a man and his wife by a gang of protestors in front of their young children, is unacceptable. By resorting to such extreme actions, the protestors undermine the very principles they uphold, violating laws of inhumanity.\n\nBanning foxhunting might drive the sport \"underground,\" making it more difficult to regulate. The sport has faced strong public opinion and protests for a long time, but this does not justify retaliatory violence. There is a compelling argument that fox hunting is a national institution and a cherished tradition that should continue. However, given the current public sentiment and the risks of illegal activities, it seems unlikely that fox hunting will be completely banned.

The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport. Many people are already working to stop the sport from taking place, and there are valid reasons for their opposition. For instance, foxes are hunted not only because they sometimes kill chickens but also because the hunters enjoy the social aspects of the sport. However, in today's world, farmers can likely devise methods to protect their chickens without resorting to killing the foxes. If such preventive measures were implemented, there would be no necessity for fox hunts, and consequently, fewer foxes would be harmed. Moreover, when hunts take place, other wildlife is often caught in the crossfire, suffering alongside the foxes. Homes of animals may be destroyed, and innocent animals might be harmed in the process. Once captured, foxes are said to suffer a cruel death, which is unfair and unjustifiable. Many people have no issue with foxes and find the hunt unjust and inhumane, as it is no longer a sport but a form of cruel entertainment. If fewer foxes are killed, it would mean fewer rabbits around to destroy crops, which would benefit many farmers and is not cruel but practical.\n\nOn the other hand, those who support the continuation of fox hunting argue that it helps keep the fox population in check, maintaining the balance of the food chain. However, foxes are not essential for controlling the rabbit population, as farmers can use other methods, such as poisons, to manage the rabbit population. Furthermore, proponents often argue that if fox hunting were banned, the activists would find another issue to protest about.

If this occurs frequently, the boxer can end his career with significant brain damage.

Provide only the final essay.\n\nOver the past two or three years there has been a continual debate over whether or not boxing should be banned. This discussion arose after lots of boxers started to get serious injuries and brain damages as a result of boxing.\nBoxing today, and has always, been a popular spectator sport and nowadays it is a big money business. Fighters, at the top, get paid millions of pounds to fight. The fighters themselves, the managers, the sponsors, the organisers, the betting shops and most spectators do not want the sport to be banned. In opposition are the people who do not like any blood sports, doctor etc, recipients of serious injuries ie, boxers themselves and their relations, etc.\nThe people who want the sport to be banned, say this because it is not right for people to fight, and there is a too high risk of serious injury and brain damage caused by the severe pounding that the head takes during a boxing match. They say that boxing should be banned because the only way to stop these accidents happening is to stop boxing, and the only way to stop people boxing is to ban boxing and make it illegal. \nThe illegalisation of boxing I believe however could only lead to the introduction of underground boxing matches if out of sight of the law. And this could be a bad thing because although there would many people there working, laying bets etc. there would be no supervision and professional referring so boxing accidents may occur and they may result worst than they do now, because there would be no immediate medical attention due to the illegal nature of the matches.\nThis may of course not happen and the banning of boxing will go down badly, but with that will be the end of it.\nThere semm to be many more reasons why boxing should be kept going rather than banned.\nOne of the major arguments is that boxing is the most natural sport in the world, and so why should it be banned just because of the risk of injury. There is just as much chance of getting brain damage by being in a car crash etc. as there is in a boxing match, and car crashes occur much more often than boxing matches.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the past two or three years, there has been a continuous debate over whether boxing should be banned, following the increasing instances of serious injuries and brain damages among boxers. Boxing, a popular spectator sport and a significant revenue generator, has always been a topic of discussion. At the top of the hierarchy, fighters earn millions of pounds for each bout, while the managers, sponsors, organizers, betting shops, and most spectators are vehemently against the ban. On the other hand, those who oppose the sport include animal rights activists, doctors, and the boxers themselves and their families, who are deeply concerned about the severe injuries and brain damage inflicted during fights.\n\nSupporters of the ban argue that it is unjust for people to engage in a fight that poses such a high risk of serious injury and brain damage, particularly due to the severe head impacts in boxing. They contend that the only way to prevent these accidents is to ban the sport, making it illegal and thus eliminating the possibility of boxing matches. I, however, believe that the illegalization of boxing could only lead to the rise of underground matches, where supervision and immediate medical attention are non-existent. This could result in even worse injuries, as there would be no professional refereeing or medical professionals to provide immediate care, exacerbating the risks.\n\nWhile there are certainly valid concerns about the safety of boxers, the reasons to keep boxing alive are compelling. One of the most significant arguments is that boxing is the most natural sport in the world, and it should not be banned simply because of the associated risks. The likelihood of brain damage from car crashes is just as high, if not higher, than from boxing matches, and car crashes occur far more frequently. Therefore, the inherent risks of boxing should be weighed against the numerous benefits, such as the economic importance to local communities, the tradition and cultural significance of the sport, and the rigorous training and discipline that boxers develop.\n\nIn conclusion, while the debate over boxing's future will undoubtedly continue, the potential benefits of the sport, combined with the reality of the risks in other areas of life, suggest that boxing should be allowed to continue with enhanced safety measures and regulations.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.\nThe brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.\nAnother aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.\nThe major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it. Boxing is one of the most popular sports, and it will be difficult to ban it.

Provide only the final essay.\n\nOne of the main arguments put forward for the abolishment of boxing is the fact that the continual pressure exerted on a boxer whilst being hit can result in death, or terminal injury.\nEach time a punch hits a boxer on the head, the brain gets jerked from one side of the head to the other, and finally stops as it hits the inner wall of the temple. One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health. \nAlso, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\nHowever, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing. Great precautions are taken to make boxing as safe a sport as possible, with several paramedics at ringside if they are needed.\nAlso, no-one is forcing boxers to fight. They have the decision as to whether or not they should participate in boxing match. Surely the choice should be theirs to make?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "One of the main arguments for abolishing boxing centers around the severe health risks, particularly the brain damage caused by repeated blows to the head. Each time a punch lands on a boxer's head, the brain jolts from side to side, eventually impacting the inner wall of the temple. While a single hit is unlikely to result in immediate injury, cumulative trauma can severely damage the brain. The brain is typically cushioned by protective fluid, but repeated impacts can gradually wear this fluid down, leaving the brain tissue with minimal protection and making it susceptible to serious damage.\n\nBoxers and fans often argue that an average fight, which lasts six 3-minute rounds, involves only about 100 head impacts. Professional boxers typically have three fights a year, resulting in approximately 300 head impacts. However, this perspective overlooks the significant number of head impacts during sparring. Boxers can receive thousands of hits in sparring sessions, which can lead to serious long-term health issues, despite the relatively low number of impacts during official fights.\n\nAnother argument against boxing is the moral issue it raises. Many view it as a bloodthirsty sport, unsuitable for modern society. A boxer's primary goal is to incapacitate their opponent, often through powerful blows. Training routines can be grueling, with some boxers working out for up to six hours daily to build the strength needed to deliver these powerful hits.\n\nDespite these concerns, boxing has a lower mortality rate compared to other sports such as horse riding or motor car racing. It is a well-regulated sport with stringent safety measures in place, including the presence of paramedics at ringside. Additionally, boxers have the right to make their own choices about whether to participate in fights. The decision to engage in boxing should be a personal one, reflecting the individual's willingness to take the risks associated with the sport.\n\nIn conclusion, while the risks of boxing cannot be ignored, the sport also presents a controlled environment with safety measures in place. The moral and health concerns must be balanced against the individual's right to choose, acknowledging that the responsibility for participating in boxing rests with the boxers themselves.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

This century it's popularity has increased greatly, due on part to the personalities of such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.\nHowever there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in the ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of \"Prince\" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.\nThis apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport. When this behaviour is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.\nWhilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as other sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing has existed in its popular form since the last century, and has undergone significant development since its early days of backstreet bare-knuckle fights. This century has witnessed a marked increase in its popularity, largely due to the charismatic personalities of boxing greats such as Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, and Henry Cooper. However, there is a tragic side to the sport that forms the basis of the anti-boxing lobby's arguments. The recent death of Scottish welterweight Jim Murray in the ring, which occurred just this October, has reignited calls for the immediate banning of boxing. This event, following closely on the heels of Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson's regrettable conditions, casts a somber light on the sport and contrasts sharply with the antics of fighters like Naseem Hussian and Chris Eubank.\n\nThe apparent barbarity of the sport is exacerbated by the behavior of certain boxers. For instance, Oliver McCall's claims that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan against Frank Bruno have given the anti-boxing lobby fresh impetus in their drive for the sport's abolition. Adding to this are the pre-fight provocations of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their matches, which further support the notion that there is an inherent danger in boxing. While such behavior cannot be condoned, it is important to remember that boxers do realize the risks of their profession, just as athletes in other sports do.\n\nFor instance, when Jim Murray tragically lost his life, there were calls for the abolition of boxing. In contrast, when Formula One driver Ayrton Senna died in a crash at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, there was little discussion about banning motor racing. Instead, the focus was on new safety measures for car design. Both sportsmen understood the risks involved in their professions, and both paid the ultimate price. This analogy suggests that banning boxing would not necessarily eliminate the dangers but might merely drive the sport underground, where safety measures and regulations would be less effective.\n\nIn conclusion, the tragic side of boxing and the behavior of certain fighters must be recognized, but the sport's potential for underground and dangerous practices underscores the necessity of maintaining its legal status. By ensuring strict regulations and safety measures, boxing can continue to thrive while minimizing the risks to participants.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

However, along with this development has come opposition from both the medical field and a proportion of the general public, who now would like to see the sport banned. \nFirstly, I would like to take the medical viewpoint. In the past not so much was know about damage caused to the brain by blows, but nowadays with advances in technology, this is more understood. The doctors are now able to see the damaging effects of repeated blows to the head, this has been supported recently by the deaths and serious mental injury suffered by well known boxers. Naturally, in their capacity of doctors they want to prevent injuries such as these occuring in the future and they feel the only way to be sure of this is to stop the sport altogether. As the sport has become more publicised, people hear more of injuries and fatalaties from around the world whereas before they only knew of a small number. Perhaps it is the fact that more is heard that there has been increased protestations from the public. I am sure that it is only a small percentage who feel strongly about the sport and would like to see it disappear. The families of those injured or killed maybe want to prevent anyone else from going through the grief and torture that they have had to endure because of the sport. In any case these people who to some may seem like killjoys only have the interests of the participants and their families at heart.\nNaturally, there is the argument for keeping boxing. As I said before, it has developed into an extremely lucrative sport with millions of pounds being offered for the elite to fight. The fight promoters and fighter managers will all be receiving large sums of money. It is these people who are directly involved with the sport who would defend it greatly. Boxing has a huge entertainment value and millions tune in to see the big names battle it out. Some of the most renound and popular sportsmen in this country are boxers and they are well respected and loved.\nBoxing, nowadays has a certain aura about it and the atmosphere is almost electric when there is a title fight.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the years, boxing has evolved into a widely enjoyed and extremely lucrative sport. However, this development has sparked opposition from both the medical field and a significant portion of the general public, who now advocate for the sport's banning.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, the landscape has shifted dramatically. In the past, the extent of brain damage caused by blows to the head was not fully understood. However, advances in technology have allowed doctors to clearly identify the harmful effects of repeated head injuries, evidenced by the recent deaths and serious mental injuries suffered by prominent boxers. Given their role as health professionals, doctors are keen to prevent such injuries from recurring. They argue that the only way to ensure this is by completely banning the sport. As boxing has gained more media coverage, the public is now made aware of a wider range of injuries and fatalities, fueling increased protests. It's important to note that this opposition is predominantly driven by a small percentage of individuals who are deeply concerned about the well-being of participants and their families. The families of those injured or killed strive to prevent others from experiencing the grief and suffering they have endured.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a strong argument for keeping boxing. The sport has become an immensely profitable enterprise, with millions of pounds at stake for elite fighters and their managers. Promoters stand to gain substantial sums, and they are likely to defend the sport vigorously. Boxing offers immense entertainment value, drawing millions of viewers to witness the spectacular battles between top athletes. Many renowned and popular sportsmen in the country are boxers, and they are widely respected and loved by the public.\n\nBoxing, in modern times, exudes a certain mystique and appeal that is unmatched by other sports. The atmosphere is electrifying, especially during title fights. This unique allure is a testament to the sport's enduring popularity and its ability to captivate audiences.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

When boxing is seen through these fighers agility and skill are thrown to the fore and the ugly side of boxing is forgotten.\nIt cannot be denied by any boxer that boxing is dangerous and that each time he walks into the ring he is risking his life? Many opponents to boxing argue that this risk in itself means that boxing is not a sport but is malicious and these boxers ought not be allowed to make that decision especially when they have families.\nduring the last year/two years there have been incidents which the sport of boxing wants to forget and try and get boxing it's name of 'entertainment' back. The arguament came to the fore again that boxing ought to be banned when Chris Eubank fought Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed and with brain damage. These two men were both professional fighters, the fact that Michael Watson has ended up how he is, is as much Michael Watson's fault for putting himself there as it is Chris Eubank's for doing it to him. However Michael Watson has never been able to forgive Chris Eubank, and many critics believe, that as sport is for enjoyment, no sporting event should end up with opponents not speaking to each other because it turns it into a war, which means a higher likelihood of someone being seriously hurt.\nAnother incident very similar to this was between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, and Gerald McClelland end up in a wheelchair. However months after this, McClelland friend Oliver McCall threatened to take revenge from McClelland on Frank Bruno. Many people say that this 'idol' talk sets a bad example for children when growing up. They don't only see, a 'superstar' in Oliver McCall threatening to paralyse Bruno but revenge is also threatened. \nThese are tragic events that no-one wants seen repeated and many opposers to boxing believe that it should not be allowed to happen again by banning the sport.\nOnly I the recent case of James Murray who tragically died was the issue brought up again.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing is a sport with two sides to it: the thrilling excitement of witnessing a great fighter like Mohamed Ali, Chris Eubank, and recently, 'Prince' Naseem Hamed, and the stark reality of its inherent dangers. When boxing is viewed through the lens of these fighters, the agility and skill showcased often overshadow the sport's darker aspects. It is undeniable that boxing carries significant risks; every time a boxer steps into the ring, he is taking a life-threatening risk. Critics argue that this inherent danger makes boxing not a sport but a malicious activity, and question why boxers should be allowed to make such dangerous decisions, especially when they have families to consider.\n\nIn the past few years, several incidents have tarnished the sport's reputation, leading to renewed calls for its banning. The most notable of these was the Chris Eubank vs. Michael Watson bout. Watson ended up paralyzed and with brain damage, a tragedy that was a result of both fighters' actions. While Michael Watson's condition was partly due to his own choices, many critics argue that such outcomes tarnish the sport's image. They contend that sports should be about enjoyment and that events leading to opponents not speaking to each other turn them into wars, significantly increasing the risk of serious injuries.\n\nA similarly tragic incident occurred between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn. McClelland's resulting paralysis was followed by threats of retaliation from McClelland's friend, Oliver McCall, against Frank Bruno. Such \"idol\" talk sets a poor example for children, who might see a \"superstar\" threatening to seriously harm another. The severity and emotional fallout of these events are hard to ignore, leading many to believe that boxing should not be permitted to repeat such tragedies.\n\nThe most recent case of James Murray's tragic death brought the issue back into the spotlight. Murray\u2019s untimely demise further underscored the risks inherent in the sport, reigniting debates about its safety and the need for stricter regulations.\n\nThese tragic events highlight the need for a reevaluation of boxing's place in our society and the measures required to mitigate these risks. While the sport remains a source of excitement and admiration, its dark side cannot be ignored, and the safety of its participants must be prioritized.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

The reasons these discussions have occurred is because of the serious injuries which have occurred in fights such as the tragic Benn-McLellan, and Eubank-Watson, matches. In both of these clashes the result of the match has been a brain injury to one of the boxers.\nWith these injuries in mind, officials and doctors have claimed that boxing is of serious risk to health, making it both inhumane and dangerous. I actually disagree with the doctors in their opinions. In the sporting world, there will always be injuries. It is an unfortunate truth that every year people will break their spine from falling from a horse, or a motor car racer will tragically die as in the case of Ayrton Senna. Even in sports such as running there has been serious leg and knee injuries which have ruined the careers of many fine athletes. When it comes to boxing, of course, two men punching each other in the head carries a risk of head injury, but so does a man climbing into a formula one racing car and travelling at speeds in excess of 180 miles per hour. Sport carries the enjoyment because of such risks, the world would be a very boring place without risk.\nTo come on to the next point, sport is an optional pastime. Noone forces boxers to step into the ring, the injuries that could occur are made painfully obvious to them by the unfortunate Michael Watson, who still attends boxing matches, but now at ringside, in a wheelchair. The famous British boxer Frank Bruno spoke about the injuries involved in the sport of boxing and he rightly said that, of course there injuries in boxing but it is a very low percentage who are injured. If boxing is banned, then why for instance are the TT races in the Isle of Man every year not banned, because they kill riders every year.\nIf boxing was banned it would be ruining the lives of many talented boxers who have one love in life, and that is boxing. If boxing was made illegal, then the sport would still take place, but it would not be under the control of doctors or referees and there would be no proper association to represent rules and regulations.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the present-day sporting world, discussions have emerged regarding the humanity of one particular sport: boxing.

Similarly, a man climbing into a Formula One racing car and traveling at speeds in excess of 180 miles per hour also faces significant risks. Sport thrives on these inherent risks; a world without risk would be a very boring place indeed.\n\nFurthermore, sport is an optional pastime. No one forces boxers to step into the ring, and the risks involved are well-known and acknowledged by them. Michael Watson, for example, continues to attend boxing matches in a wheelchair, a stark reminder of the dangers involved. The former British boxer Frank Bruno eloquently stated that while injuries occur in boxing, the risk is relatively low. He suggested that if boxing were banned, why not ban the dangerous TT races in the Isle of Man, which also result in fatalities every year.\n\nBanning boxing would ruin the lives of many talented boxers who find joy and purpose in the sport. If boxing were made illegal, the sport would likely continue to be practiced without proper regulation. Boxing would lose its association with doctors and referees, and there would be no governing body to represent rules and regulations. Therefore, while the sport undoubtedly carries risks, its unique benefits and the choices of its participants make it a valuable and necessary part of the sporting world.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight. If not killed then more likely paralysed.

Over the past two years there has been many events which has marred boxing as a 'brutal sport'. In the Eubank-Watson fight, just over two years ago, Watson was left at the end of a great fight unconscious and fighting for his life. He had suffered a major blot clot in his brain and after serious surgery and over eight months I hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a serious speaking disorder. One young man's life smashed by just a twelve round fight. Nearly one year ago another man, McClellan, was also left in a critical condition after his fight with Eubank. He is still in hospital  to this day, recovering. The most recent incident which has fuelled the debate has been the death of the young Scotsman - James Murray. After suffering a brain haemorage during his World Championship defence, he was left in a coma with serious brain damage. He died later the next day. These three events are only a fraction of the incidents occuring in a boxing ring which have caused controversy over the sport.\nA boxer's risks do not stop when he retires. Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in the sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain. This damage has built up every fight and the boxer is ore likely, even though he doesn't perticipitate in the sport any more, to have a brain haemorrage or a stroke. They are also very likely to suffer, in their old age, from a serious and sometimes fatal disease called Parkinson's disease. It affects the nervous system very badly and can lead, in some cases, to paralysation. Is this kind of a risk really worth a life in the sport of boxing?\nThere are, however, many reasons why the sport of boxing should not be banned.

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery was criticized before its introduction as \"a tax on the stupid,\" a two-pronged argument that directed objections against both the government and its marketing strategies.

Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA) the lottery was most popular with people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty. Stuck in the poverty trap, where any wages are offset by the twas in benifits,  it was predicted that people would spend money they couldn't afford on a gamble they had no chance in winning. Early research centred on inner city areas with high unemployment indicates that on average, regular participants of the Lottery spend about \u00a310 a week.\nMany critics of the Lottery felt that because a proportion of the profits were going to be given to good causes, people would  be 'conned' into playing the Lottery because they would think they had been giving money to charity. It is now known that only eight pence in the pound has been given to good causes, and this has also resulted in another of the warnings being proved correct; that donations to legitimate charities has significanlly fallen since the introcution of the Lottery.\nOpposition to the lottery by betting shops was disregarded by many but the popularity of other forms of gambling have also fallen since the Lottery's introduction. This has resulted in many betting shops having to close down, resulting in unemployment. The fear of a nation of gamblers was one which caused many people to be opposed to the lottery, and its massive popularity seems to indicate to this.

It is now clear that the majority has gone straight into Camelot's pockets, and if the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering Virgin were prepared to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise, and giving all the profits to the government.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "One of the biggest arguments against the introduction of the Lottery was that it would become, effectively, a \"poor person's tax.\" Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA), where the lottery is most popular among those who see it as their sole means of escaping a lifetime of poverty, the same is expected here.

It is now clear that the majority is going into the pockets of Camelot. If the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering that Virgin was willing to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise and give all the profits to the government.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

The vast majority saw the idea as an exciting one and were interested in taking part in such a large-scale competition where such huge amounts of money were at stake. However, some people saw the lottery as a bad thing which would tend to become a hopeless addiction. These people tended to be those whose ideas and actions the general public are expected to follow; such as church leaders, or members of Parliament.\nThe arguments which these people suggested were numerous. Firstly, the amount of money which the jackpot winners were likely to receive was deemed as 'too much' or even 'unseemly'. The objectors felt that such a large amount of money (up to \u00a39 million on any normal lottery draw) was too much to be given to just one party. The recent 'double rollover' jackpot fund gave a figure of \u00a342 million which, theoretically, could have gone to just one lucky winner. This was deemed by the Bishop of Durham as 'an obscene amount of money', and many other members of the religious fraternity agreed and made their thoughts on the matter public.\nSecondly, many people believe that the amount of the cost of each ticket which goes to various charities is far too little. At present this stands at 5%. People feel that this amount is not enough, especially as one of the main reasons for the introduction of a British national lottery was the issue of raising funds for home charities and needy causes.\nThis issue is coupled with the profit margin which the lottery organisers, Camelot, obtain. People deemed this to be far too high and believed that if some of the profits which Camelot gained were transferred to the charity fund, things would be a lot fairer for everyone.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When the UK's National Lottery was first discussed, people were instantly divided in opinion.

These concerns often came from influential figures such as church leaders or members of Parliament, whose opinions the general public tended to follow.\n\nThese objectors brought up several arguments against the lottery. Firstly, they questioned the vast sums of money that jackpot winners could receive, deeming such amounts \"too much\" or even \"unseemly.\" For example, the Bishop of Durham described a \u00a39 million jackpot as \"an obscene amount of money,\" a view that was echoed by many other religious leaders. This argument highlighted the fear that such large payouts could lead to irresponsible spending or even financial ruin.\n\nSecondly, many people believed that a significant portion of the proceeds should go to various charities, but the current 5% contribution felt inadequate. They felt that a larger share of lottery revenues should support home charities and needy causes, especially given that one of the main reasons for introducing a national lottery was to raise funds for such purposes.\n\nThis concern about charity contributions was compounded by the perceived high profit margin that Camelot, the lottery organizers, was earning. Critics argued that a portion of Camelot's profits should be redirected to the charity fund, making the system more equitable for all parties involved and ensuring that more of the lottery's revenues could directly support charitable causes.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

However, with the weight of the government behind it, the National Lottery was eventually approved. \nMuch of the objection to the National Lottery came from church leaders. Bishops from the Church of England have condemned the widespread encouragement of gambling, leaders of the Methodist church have expressed great concern at the effect on low income families who spend more than they can afford on tickets, and cardinals in the Catholic church have criticised the system for sharing out the 'good causes' money.\nDisasters, from a public relations point of view, has followed Camelot, the managers of the National Lottery, from the start. The first multi-million winner's request for no publicity was ignored by Camelot, who dropped hints about his identity to the press until they tracked him down. Arguments for jackpot capping have been put forward by the opposition in Parliament and in editorials in the broadsheets, and recently in the Sun the editorial suggested that there should be a maximum jackpot of \u00a310 million. The recent controversy about the impartiality of the head of Office, the lottery regulator, in accepting gifts from one member of the Camelot consortium, has made it look increasingly likely that Camelot's license will not be renewed when it expires in a few years.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The introduction of a National Lottery in Britain in November 1994 followed a lengthy period of controversy.

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points. Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ephasised in this essay. I believeit is a benefit to the country.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994, and since its first draw, it has captivated millions of people across the country, with its popularity growing steadily each week. However, the proposal of the lottery sparked numerous objections and complaints, primarily centered around two significant concerns.\n\nFirst, there are financial implications that disproportionately affect the \"working class citizens.\" These individuals often work hard throughout the year but struggle to afford the weekly \u00a310-20 expenditure on the National Lottery. Their financial position is more vulnerable, and the risk of overspending is a genuine concern. Conversely, people in higher society can afford to indulge in the 'flutter' without significant financial strain.\n\nThe second major issue is the promotion of gambling. The National Lottery, fundamentally, is a form of gambling, with the probability of winning the jackpot standing at approximately 1 in 14 million and the odds of winning just \u00a310 being around 1 in 58. Furthermore, the lottery is accessible to individuals as young as 16, which raises concerns. The allure of instant wins, particularly with scratch cards, can be particularly alluring, attracting both young and old gamblers. This easy access and the promise of instant wealth can lead to problematic behaviors, especially among those who are more financially vulnerable.\n\nDespite these challenges, the National Lottery has significant benefits. One of its most notable advantages is the substantial support it provides to charities and communities. The lottery has funded a wide range of projects, from providing expensive equipment for children with brain problems to building new village halls in remote areas. Such initiatives have positively impacted both young and old individuals, contributing to the well-being of communities across the country.\n\nMoreover, the lottery has contributed to the economy by creating jobs and encouraging consumer spending. It has also sparked dreams of financial prosperity for many participants, offering a glimmer of hope in the form of potential wealth.\n\nIn conclusion, the National Lottery has its fair share of advantages and disadvantages. The decision on whether its introduction was beneficial ultimately depends on one's perspective. While the lottery presents risks, particularly for the less financially secure, it also provides vital support to charitable causes and helps to create a sense of hope and possibility for many. I believe that, on balance, it is a net positive for the country.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

The basic principlees behind the lottery are that a small  number of people are able to become monumentally rich from the contributions of many. Despite objections, the vast majority of lottery players see it as harmless fun which won't break the bank.\nThe main objection to the lottery is based on the grounds that those who play it most are those who can afford it the least. Many Britons are in situations of poverty where the lack of employment prospects and the deterioration of the welfare state means that the lottery is seen as the only way to solve their problems. The idea that the 'quick fix' can turn their lives around seems to mask the fact that they are spending what they cant afford. By the laws of averages, the population stands to lose out as only fifty per-cent of money is allocated to the prizes. It is believed that the only winners will be the government who take a cut, camelot - the organisers - and the small number of participants who 'get lucky'. Many argue that the spread of wealth across Britain is uneven enough as it is. The Lottery would create more 'super-rich' people whilst reducing the financial capabilities of those at the lower end of the spectrum. Yet these people would get into a vicious circle where the only way to pay off gambling debts would be to win, and so the problem increases.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery has faced significant criticism, particularly from those who view it as detrimental to the country's social fabric.

For them, the lottery represents the only potential avenue for financial improvement. The illusion of a 'quick fix' to their problems seems to overshadow the reality that they are spending money they cannot afford. Statistically, the odds are against them; only half of the lottery revenue goes towards prizes, with significant portions going to the government, Camelot\u2014the organizers\u2014and the fortunate few who win. This leaves the general population at a disadvantage, where only a select few benefit.\n\nMoreover, critics argue that the spread of wealth across Britain is already uneven. The introduction of the lottery would further exacerbate this inequality, creating more 'super-rich' individuals while simultaneously reducing the financial capabilities of those at the lower end of the spectrum. This situation could lead to a vicious cycle, where the only way to pay off gambling debts is to win the lottery, perpetuating the problem rather than solving it.", "speed": 0.45319200634644324, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

The second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery, as people would be less likely to give money to charity, instead buying a lottery ticket, with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity.\nThere was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise, which eventually went to Camelot, which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid: other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs. Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity, but was rejected. My personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms, for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot.

There has also been some controversy over the allocation of money. For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house.

As people would increasingly opt to buy lottery tickets instead, with the mistaken belief that a portion of the proceeds would go to charity, the overall charitable giving was expected to decrease.\n\nControversy also surrounded the awarding of the lottery organization franchise, which ultimately went to Camelot, a company not seen as the strongest contender. Other companies or consortiums had promised to allocate more money to charity with lower operating costs, and Richard Bronson even pledged all profits to charity but was not chosen. My personal reservations regarding Camelot's selection as the lottery organizer stemmed from the fact that a significant proportion of the consortium is American or foreign, with IBM holding a substantial stake. This raised concerns about a British national lottery being run by non-British firms.\n\nSince its introduction, the national lottery has faced ongoing controversies. The lottery's initial promise to distribute 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes was met with skepticism, as it was not specified that the majority or entirety of this amount would be directed to charitable purposes. Controversies have also arisen over the allocation of funds. For instance, 3 million pounds were allocated to Eton College, one of the wealthiest public schools, for a gymnasium, and money was given to the Royal Opera House.

Consequently many people who may have otherwise not gambled, become addicted to gambling.\nSecondly, gambling is indulged in by a large number of people on lower incomes, who attempt to win prizes to improve their low standard of living. Due to the massive sizes of some of the Lottery jackpots many people are persuaded to spend large proportions of their income on trying to win an amount of money that would considerably change their life.\nAnother critisism is of the size of the jackpots themselves. Many people believe that the size of the main prizes are so great that winners find it difficult to comprehend the amount of money they have won and consequently it is often spent or invested unwisely. Also because of the amount of money won winning the Lottery jackpot can often run peoples lives. Many people claim, after winning a jackpot, you slowly lose friends and can become completely cut off from the lifestyle you were previously used to. In fact it is claimed that the only way to keep friends is to not mention that you have won the jackpot.\nHowever the Lottery also has its beneficial aspects: The lottery raises an enormous amount of revenue for the Government, which would otherwise to have been raised through increased taxes. This money is mostly then invested into important institutions by the Heritage Fund. Consequently it has enabled the survival of many theatres and other places of historic and cultural interest. Another positive point is that the Lottery is entirely voluntary; those who disapprove need to pay.\n Also the lottery helps to retain small shops and newsagents from being 'chased out of business' by bigger chains and supermarkets. The Lottery organiser, Camelot decided to only sell the lottery tickets from small shops and post-offices to increase their trade and also they gain some of the revenue (around 5p in every \u00a31) from the tickets.\nClearly the National Lottery has its positive and negative aspects.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When the National Lottery was introduced, 14 months ago, many arguments were presented regarding its continuation or decline. The primary concerns revolved around its wide-scale promotion, which expanded the gambling audience and potentially led to addiction. To illustrate, by highlighting a gambling event on such a broad scale, the Lottery brought it to a larger audience than it might have reached otherwise. This, in turn, attracted individuals who might not have gambled before, potentially leading them to become addicted.\n\nAdditionally, it was argued that gambling is often a pastime of people with lower incomes, who use Lottery tickets as a way to improve their living conditions. The substantial jackpots offered by the Lottery often persuaded many to spend a significant portion of their income on the chance to win life-changing amounts of money. The size of these jackpots also led to another criticism: winners found it difficult to comprehend the sheer volume of money they had won, often leading to imprudent spending or investment.\n\nHowever, the Lottery also presented several positive aspects. For one, it generated a substantial amount of revenue for the government, which would otherwise have been obtained through higher taxes. This money was then invested into cultural and historical institutions through the Heritage Fund, ensuring the survival of many theaters and other important cultural sites. Moreover, the Lottery was entirely voluntary, allowing those who did not wish to participate to abstain without financial penalty.\n\nAnother benefit was the support it provided to small shops and newsagents. By selling lottery tickets exclusively through these smaller businesses and post-offices, Camelot aimed to bolster their trade. These smaller stores and newsagents, often threatened by bigger chains and supermarkets, benefited from the increased foot traffic and revenue generated by lottery ticket sales.\n\nClearly, the National Lottery holds both positive and negative aspects. While it has contributed to significant revenue generation and cultural preservation, it also poses risks such as increased gambling addiction and financial mismanagement among winners.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Some people have become millionaires overnight because their numbers have been picked out.

One of Britain's most famous businesses and Families had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies and Littlewards, in particular, were particularly worried about the start of the National Lottery. They were worried that people instead of spending money on the 'pools', would stake a \u00a31 on the National Lottery instead. This was a major part of their argument, that the National Lottery would take their business away and due to this they would have no need to employ as many workers, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, already an unemployment problem spot.\nCharities were worried that they would lose out. They had been promised a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) going to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon. Clubs and charities who sold scratch cards as a source of income were worried because they thought nobody would buy their cards. They could not offer large money prizes like the Lottery. More worries were expressed when the Lottery's own scratch cards were introduced, possibly meaning even less money for charities.\nLarge debate centred around which organisations stood to benefit from the profits made by the Lottery. Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed. Sports teams, clubs, social groups and communities applied for cash for new facilities and then John Major announced some profits would be used for the construction of a British Academy of Sport.

The general consensus of the British people was that it was exciting, but also very easy to win. This has however been purely fantasy and the number of people who are acting cynically about the Lottery is slowly increasing. However the company who run the National Lottery, Camelot, are trying to keep up the illusion of mystery and excitment by increasing the jackpot to 40 million and introducing instans. Also thier extensive advertising campaign and even thier name, the fabled home of king Auther, are all thier to try to get people with barely enough money to live on to waste it in search of thier fortune. Almost weekly there are stories of people who have gone bankrupt just trying to win. It is a mass produced, user friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes which you are encouraged to do by the government. It has been calle 'the tax for the poor' as inevitably the people who have least will want to win most and waste money they can not afford to. However it is so popular that the party which removes it will be the most unpopular that has been. There are many groups who are campaigning against the lottery. The most promentant of these are the church and many charity groups. The churches main arguement is that it is causing misery to thousands of people. Those who have been come addicted and have spent every thing they own on it and those who don't have enough money to feed themselves even before they waste there money on odds of illions to one which any regular gambler knows are not worth a second look. The church and charities also argue that they are loosing money  which they so desperately need to help millions of over the world as oppose to the one person who recieves millioins each week. The lottery does give a very small proportion of its earnings to charity however and international charity which saves millions of people each year would get less money than a school who wants a new sports hall.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are numerous causes both for and against the National Lottery, each with its own valid reasoning.

The churches argue that the Lottery is causing misery for thousands of people, as some become addicted and spend every penny they have on tickets, often leaving them with nothing to feed themselves. The churches and charities also contend that they are losing funds desperately needed to help millions of people worldwide, rather than a single individual who wins millions each week. While the lottery does contribute a small portion of its earnings to charity, the distribution is often criticized.

These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and other more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would have been donated to charity.\nAnother objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more on the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young people (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people. \nFinally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as \u00a340 million. Groups such as church teachers felt that this was too much money for one person to have when there were so many problems such as famine and homelessness in the world.

It can take quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).\n\tIt is possible to say that using computers do not stop us using our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After all somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.\n\tPeople claim that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping your finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\tDespite computers saving time, they do everything for you at the touch of a button, solve the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This is why it could be said we don't use our brains as much.\n\tFrom simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. In the control room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. I cannot see much brain power needed for that.\n\tComputers can communiate with each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I think it is possible to argue that the computer has made us both use and not use our brains more for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the introduction of computers has certainly made us think more due to the complexity of the programs used on them. Learning how to use these programs can take a considerable amount of time, and as soon as one program or computer is released, people begin to consider ways to improve it. After all, it is ultimately humans who invented the computer, and it cannot replace the human brain (not yet, anyway!). \n\nMoreover, using computers does not necessarily mean we are not using our brains; they are simply quick, efficient time savers. For instance, instead of having to write letters by hand, using a word processing program ensures we do not have to start over if we make a mistake. This convenience allows us to focus on the content rather than the mechanics of writing. \n\nCritics argue that computer games do not require much brainpower. However, some games are so challenging that players consult with others worldwide to overcome them. This collaborative effort demonstrates the use of our brains in creative and strategic ways. Conversely, games that rely solely on repetitive button pressing do indeed limit our cognitive engagement. \n\nDespite these benefits, computers can also hinder our brain usage. They save time by solving difficult sums, checking for spelling errors, and performing numerous other tasks at the touch of a button. This reliance on technology can lead us to underutilize our cognitive abilities.\n\nFrom simple tasks like homework to complex operations in industries and power stations, computers handle much of the work. For example, at Heyshams Nuclear Power Station, a single man operates the facility, with millions of pounds worth of computers managing the rest. This automation raises questions about the extent of human brainpower required for such tasks.\n\nIn summary, while computers undoubtedly enhance our technological capabilities, they can also limit our cognitive engagement. The balance between using and not using our brains depends on how we choose to interact with these powerful tools.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Yet there are many situations where humans can travel through on foot that wheeled vehicles cannot cope, as any wheel-chair bound person would testify. The computer is a tool to be used to aid human brains and bodies, but does not (yet) come close to making them redundant.\n\tRecently, a fuss was made in the newspapers over falling ability at mental arithmetic in schoolchildren. This was attributed to the rising use of calculators in schools, and newspaper articles claimed that children were losing their ability to think for themselves, due to overuse of calculators. Surely, though, it is poor teaching on the part of primary school teachers, and the fault of our `progressive' teaching policy, that allows children to pass on memorising times tables in favour of simply having calculators at the ready at all times?\n\tThe reason that computers have not made the human brain redundant is that they are, in the most literal sense of the word, idiotic. They have no ability to think, or be creative, or be spontaneous. They simply perform millions of calculations, very quickly, following instructions laid out by a human. It is impossible for a computer to produce a list of truly random numbers, for example, something an eight-year old child can do with ease. The closest that can happen is for a programmer to invent an appropriately complicated set of instructions (an algorithm) that will deliver an approximation of a set of random numbers. Of course, once this is done, the computer can quickly calculate millions of (pseudo) random numbers far more quickly than a human.\n\tResearch in artificial intelligence, the attempt to produce a \"thinking\" computer, has grown massively in the last decade, yet we are little closer to producing any true artificial life for it. The definition of artificial life that is now most widely used was set out in the 1950's. It involves a set up of three computers, linked so that what one person types on his screen appears also on the other two.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In many ways, this question is akin to asking, \"How far has the human foot been made redundant by the invention of the wheel?\" While computers perform many tasks better than humans, especially repetitive mathematical calculations, they cannot replace the versatility and adaptability of human feet, much like how wheeled vehicles are not always the best option for navigating certain terrains. Similarly, computers are tools to enhance human capabilities, but they do not (yet) render human brains and bodies redundant.\n\nRecently, a debate arose in newspapers over the declining ability of schoolchildren in mental arithmetic, attributed to the increasing use of calculators in schools. Newspaper articles claimed that children were losing their ability to think for themselves due to overreliance on calculators. However, the fault lies more with poor teaching and an overly progressive educational policy that prioritizes instant access to calculators over the memorization of times tables. \n\nThe inability of computers to replicate the human brain's cognitive functions is stark. In essence, computers are \"idiotic\" in that they lack the capacity for true thinking, creativity, or spontaneity. They can perform millions of calculations rapidly, but they follow pre-programmed instructions. A computer can approximate a set of random numbers but cannot generate them truly. An eight-year-old child, in contrast, can produce a list of random numbers with ease. Once a computer can generate a set of pseudo-random numbers, it can do so much more efficiently than a human ever could.\n\nResearch in artificial intelligence, aimed at developing \"thinking\" computers, has seen significant growth in recent decades. Yet, we remain far from producing true artificial life. The current definition of artificial life, established in the 1950s, involves connecting three computers so that a person\u2019s input appears on all three screens. While this may seem like a step towards true artificial intelligence, the reality is that we have not significantly advanced beyond this concept. The complexity required to simulate human thought processes remains beyond our current technological capabilities.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

There are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society. One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry. Since the early 1980's, when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people, controversy has followed about their effect on children. There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child's ability to learn. The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the \"problem\". The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children. However, parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn. Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer, the calculator, to help them.\n\tAnother moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace. There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace. The role of computers is already significant in employment areas, such as accountancy, which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers. These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result. As the computers are: more efficient than humans, do not require payment for their work, are less temperamental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill, it seems mankind is faced with a great problem.\n\tAnother claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti-social behaviour. The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become unsociable. The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to, supposedly, make life easier for us.

Such developments have both made the human brain more dependent upon the computer as its increased usage has made various parts of the brain lazy. On the other hand the discoveries made by computers have stimulated the human brain to further fields of thought. However, which has a greater effect on us and why depends much on our circumstances.\n\tIn the world today children are taught about things which have only come to light as a result of the technological revolution, namely the computer. For example the nature of the sun's surface has been made available by computer technology. This provides simple additional information not requiring the brain to think much, unless one is able to think around it such as in companion to other planet's surfaces. Therefore, the human brain whilst dependent upon its data from the computer is able to establish more lines of thought and expand its capacity. However it is also important that children do not become overreliant upon computers from an early age as they will not have the chance to develop their own brain in doing subjects, such as mathematics. However as more and more children become acquainted with computers their brain becomes lazier in carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Therefore, the child must be taught to be independent before being introduced to computers by which it may expand its knowledge and understanding.\n\tIndeed computers are simply the result of what humans know and thus have instructed the computer to do. They are man-made and thus have been established by our own brain power, and so have been programmed with a similar line of thought. This argument could point to computers as the replacement of human brains yet their development is similar to ours, as we programme them according to the knowledge which we acquire. Therefore, the human brain should be able to understand a computer's programme and line of thought as being similar to its own. This point of view displays the computer as a substitute for a human brain which, once skilled in its use, is a major problem in its use by many people.\n\tHowever to those in complex fields such as physics the computer has been able to stimulate the human brain on to further research.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The invention of the computer has facilitated the human brain's role in many areas, including spelling, mathematics, physics, and geography. These developments have both increased the brain's dependence on the computer and made various parts of the brain \"lazy\" due to increased usage. On the other hand, the discoveries made by computers have stimulated the human brain to explore new fields of thought. However, which of these effects is more significant depends largely on individual circumstances.\n\nIn today's world, children are taught about phenomena that have only become available through technological advances, such as the sun's surface, which is now accessible through computer technology. This information provides additional, easily digestible facts that do not necessarily require deep thought, unless the child is able to draw connections to other planetary surfaces. Consequently, the human brain, while still dependent on the computer for data, can establish new lines of thought and expand its cognitive capacity.\n\nHowever, it is crucial that children do not become overly reliant on computers from an early age, as this may stifle the development of their own cognitive abilities, particularly in subjects like mathematics, where problem-solving skills are essential. As more children are introduced to computers at a younger age, their brains may become less adept at performing even simple tasks without assistance, underscoring the importance of fostering independence before computer exposure.\n\nMoreover, computers are the result of human knowledge and instruction, meaning they are man-made and programmed based on our own brain power and similar lines of thought. This argument highlights the potential for computers to serve as substitutes for human brains, especially once users are skilled in their use. However, this point of view also shows that the computer's thought processes are fundamentally similar to our own, as they are programmed based on the knowledge we acquire.\n\nFor those in complex fields like physics, computers have the potential to stimulate further research and innovation. In physics, for example, computers can simulate complex theories, allowing researchers to test and refine their ideas in ways that would be impossible with manual calculations alone. This not only enhances our understanding of the subject but also pushes the boundaries of human knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between the human brain and the computer is complex and context-dependent. While computers have undoubtedly facilitated cognitive development and exploration in many areas, they also pose risks of dependency and \"laziness.\" Balancing these factors requires mindful integration of technology in education and professional settings, ensuring that the human brain remains the primary driving force in thought and discovery.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Do not add new content or examples\u2014only improve how existing ideas are connected and expressed. Provide only the final essay.\n\nIn analysing how far the invention of the computer has made the human brain redundant, we must remember that changes in the demand for computers has certainly not been universal. While \"Western\" developed countries have begun popularising the computer, developing countries have very much been left in the dark as their education levels and culture do not allow for mass computer demand.\n\tThe invention of the computer meant that industry could benefit from the further technological inventions that followed. Robotic production of cars, for example, allowed many firms to increase their efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, the advent of computer usage in the home could be argued to increase educational levels. As supply in computers through changing technology arrived, so demand was to gradually increase in the long term, both for the individual and for the firm. This long term change in demand can be charted to see if it has lead to a drastic fall in the usage of the human brain.\n\tAs I have said, changing technology has allowed factories to use robots for production. It has also created the internet, a global forum linking every part of the world up so that information can be passed on more easily. Similarly, the computer has also brought society video games, in the form of companies such as Sega and Nintendo. We must ask if such video games are detrimental to the youth of the world and also its population, or whether they relieve stress and form part of modern life. They do utilise the brain, testing reaction times and lateral thinking skill, but is this escapism a good or a bad thing? There is certainly a change in attitudes in society.\n\tSecondly, educational levels in the developed world have also changed drastically wih the technological revolution of the computer. On the one hand, clearly this has lead to a decrease in primary and secondary labour sectors. That is, in agriculture and more importantly in manufacturing. Robots replace people and computers mean that only one supervisor - or head of technology - is needed on a factory production line.\n\tYet amongst the job losses through this, in the UK students in sixth form wishing to go on to university are nearing the highest level they've ever been. Computerised administration systems aid this, and while at university computers are used heavily in all subjects as an educational aid.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In analyzing how the invention of the computer has impacted the human brain's role in society, it is crucial to recognize that the adoption of computers has not been universally uniform. While \"Western\" developed countries have embraced computer technology, developing nations have lagged behind due to lower education levels and cultural barriers. Consequently, the demand for computers in developing countries has remained limited.\n\nThe invention of the computer has undeniably spurred further technological advancements that have benefited industries. For instance, robotic car production has significantly increased efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, the home computer has also contributed positively by enhancing educational levels. As computer technology evolved and became more accessible, so did its demand, both among individuals and businesses. This gradual increase in demand can be tracked over time, providing insights into whether it has led to a significant reduction in the reliance on human brains.\n\nTechnological advancements have transformed industrial practices, enabling the widespread use of robots for production. Additionally, the internet has emerged as a global platform, facilitating the easy exchange of information across the world. Video games, too, have become a part of modern life, exemplified by companies like Sega and Nintendo. The question arises: are these games detrimental to society, particularly youth, or do they serve as a beneficial form of stress relief and intellectual engagement? Video games indeed engage the brain, testing reaction times and fostering lateral thinking. However, the debate over whether this escapism is positive or negative remains unresolved. There is a notable shift in societal attitudes towards such digital activities.\n\nMoreover, the technological revolution driven by computers has profoundly altered educational levels in developed nations. While computers have led to a decline in the reliance on human labor in primary and secondary sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, they have also brought about new educational opportunities. In the UK, for example, the number of sixth-form students aspiring to university has reached unprecedented levels. Computerized administrative systems support this trend, and universities increasingly rely on computers as educational tools across all disciplines.\n\nIn conclusion, while the computer has undoubtedly transformed various aspects of society, its impact on human brain usage remains complex and multifaceted. The shift towards automation and digitalization may reduce the need for manual labor, but it also opens new avenues for intellectual and educational growth. The evolving landscape of technology continues to shape how we interact with and utilize the human brain.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

The goverment claim that it will not effect humans and the tabloids argue it will effect us if we eat it. The recent experiment on mice which supposidly proved that there is no link between B.S.E and the human equivalent was not seen as good evidence for the campaign by the Goverment.\nIf the papers keep plugging away, saying \"beef is bad for you\", the people will slowly stop eating beef and choose a suitable replacement, for example lamb. It is in my view therefore that it is press blowing the situation out of all proportions that will be the down fall of beef in the U.K. It was not long ago that the press anounced a killer bug eating people alive, thus catching the attention of the U.K. When the press got bored of this story, the bug dissappeared and with it peoples worries about its effects. When in reality it has still the same precense now as it ever had. \"Out of sight, out of mind\", to coin an old phrase. If beef is left out of the publics eye, it will surely also go into the back of peoples minds along with, Salmonella, killer bugs and who knows what else the press drag up. \nSchools and some hospitals, households are already publicised as \"beef free\" and this is on the increase causing a fall in the demand for beef in the U.K. This fall in demand is causing a large fall in price of the product and thus a fall in the income of farmers and the industry as a whole. <figure> The simple supply and demand curve shows how a fall in beef will lead to a fall in prices as farmers are not likely to reduce supply as this would mean large scale slaughter and disposal of hundreds of beef cattle. If the beef industry wants to survive there may be no option but to reduce supply S2 and keep price P1, but as with other agricultural commodities supply is difficult to alter.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The people in the United Kingdom will cease to eat beef if they see more evidence linking it to the human equivalent of \"mad cow's disease\" or BSE, as it is also known. While the government claims that beef consumption is not harmful, tabloids argue the opposite. The recent experiment on mice that supposedly proved no link between BSE and the human condition was not convincing enough to bolster the government's campaign.\n\nIf the media continues to emphasize that beef is bad for human health, the public is likely to gradually stop eating it and seek suitable alternatives, such as lamb. In my opinion, it is the media's tendency to exaggerate the situation that will ultimately lead to the decline of beef consumption in the UK. Just a short while ago, the press sensationalized a \"killer bug\" that was reported to eat people alive, capturing the public's attention. When the media lost interest in the story, the bug and public concerns about it disappeared, only to be replaced by other pressing issues like Salmonella and other food scares.\n\nSchools, some hospitals, and households are already promoting \"beef-free\" options, which are becoming more prevalent. This shift is leading to a decline in the demand for beef in the UK, causing a significant drop in its price and the income of farmers and the industry as a whole. The fall in demand can be illustrated by a simple supply and demand curve, where a decrease in beef demand leads to a drop in prices. Farmers are unlikely to reduce supply significantly, as mass disposal of cattle would be economically disastrous. For the beef industry to survive, it may have to reduce supply to keep prices stable, but this is a challenging task given the difficulty in altering agricultural commodity supply.\n\nIn conclusion, the future of the beef industry in the UK is closely tied to public perception, heavily influenced by media reports. If the media can manage to keep the issue in the public eye and continue to emphasize potential risks, the industry may face an uncertain future. However, if the media eventually moves on to other stories, the issue may fade into public memory, much like the forgotten \"killer bug.\" Therefore, the fate of beef consumption in the UK is largely in the hands of the media and their ability to sustain public concern.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to consume beef products due to the resurgence of BSE, or \"Mad Cow Disease,\" which became widespread in cattle several years ago.

More alarmingly, BSE has been found to cross species barriers, with sheep developing a similar disease after consuming feed made from meat remnants of dead cows. Now, scientists fear that the disease has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there is a notable increase in cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD). There is currently no cure for CJD, and the only known route of human infection is through the consumption of beef products. This situation has significantly reduced public trust in beef consumption, exacerbated by media coverage of government inefficiency in quality control and the disease's long incubation period, which can last up to 15-20 years. Even if people decide to stop eating beef today, they still run the risk of contracting CJD in the future. However, reducing beef consumption now could lower the likelihood of contracting the disease in the long term.\n\nIf a significant number of people were to give up beef products, it would have significant impacts on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers would be hit especially hard due to reduced demand. This shift in consumer preference would likely increase demand for meat from other sources, such as sheep and pigs, potentially lowering the price of beef. Some consumers might opt for beef despite the risks, finding it cheaper than alternative meats. If beef consumption continues to decline, cows might be bred primarily for their milk, leading to a reduction in the cow population. This change would also likely result in job losses for abattoir workers and butchers who rely on beef sales for a significant portion of their income.\n\nIn contrast, politicians continue to maintain that beef is safe to eat and that they will continue to consume it, despite the growing concerns among the public.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

This increase has been blown out of proportion by the British press who have given the idea to the public that eating British beef can lead to the human equivalent. C.J.D, in its worst cases, can cause death, however, they majority of cases involve severe damage to the brain, leaving most sufferers totally dependant on others. It is also the case, however, that the link between the consumption of British beef and C.J.D has certainly not been proven, infact from testing on mice it seems unlikely. Even though figures have risen in the U.K concerning the number of deaths resulting from C.J.D, this is considered by most experts to be merely due to the advances in medical technology so that they are now able to diagnose more cases, which would have previously gone unreported. A further factor which is often not realised is that the occurrence of C.J.D is not only limited to this country, infact the Netherlands has a higher resultant death rate. (Although, the U.S.A is admittedly lower).\nTherefore, the scare over beef is not really justified but due to the effects of the press and the media, it is possible that the C.J.D scare could cause detrimental effects to the British farming community. \nThe introduction of the common agricultural policy after the war was aimed at making most European counties self-sufficient, due to the fact that during the war counties like Britain almost starved to death due to the heavy reliance on imported food. Therefore, Britain has achieved near full self-sufficiency, due to the supported income farmers recieve, whereby the European Union guarantees to buy any unsold stock at market price, so as to keep farmers in business. Therefore, the effects of a beef scare, would reduce public demand dramatically. <figure>\nTherefore, in simple terms the EU will be faced with a surplus of Q1-Q2, which could mean the imposition of further restrictions on production, called quotas.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The discovery of B.S.E., and although not yet fully proven, the human equivalent C.J.D., has had significant impacts on both public health and the existence of farmers as part of a much-needed and profitable industry.

It is important to note, however, that the link between B.S.E. and C.J.D. has not been definitively proven. Tests on mice suggest that the link is unlikely. Moreover, the increase in C.J.D. deaths in the U.K. is largely attributed to advancements in medical technology that allow for better diagnosis and reporting of cases, which would have gone unnoticed in the past.

The rise of vegetarianism.\ni.) BSE is a disease that has been around for some time now in many forms. It affects sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE) and humans (CJD). All of these diseases are similar in progression and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are called <?>, or protein fragments, and are tiny non-living infectious particles. They must be actively taken in by an animal (i.e. they must be eaten) to have any effect. They are very resilient to heat and so cooking possibly infected food does not help. When BSE was first publicised in the mass media several years ago, there was a huge outcry: - people were worried that they would catch the human form of the disease and so experts were brought in to calm people down. After a while, as often happens, people largely forgot about BSE, but it didn't go away. The problem was that increasing numbers of herd animals were having to be destroyed as they displayed BSC symptoms. However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?\" The government reply was along lines of: \"Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten,\" i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then a recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country. The government strenuously denied this, making matters worse, and as nobody knows the real situation or even if CJD can be caught from eating infected beef, many people would seem unwilling to take the risk.

The BSE issue, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a disease that has been around for some time, affecting sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE), and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD). All these diseases share similar progression and are likely to have the same cause, attributed to prions, which are infectious protein fragments. Prions must be actively ingested to cause any effect and are highly resilient to heat, making cooking potentially infected food ineffective.\n\nWhen BSE was first publicized in the mass media several years ago, there was an immediate public outcry as people worried about contracting the human form of the disease. Experts were brought in to reassure the public, but as often happens, this concern was largely forgotten over time. However, the problem persisted, with an increasing number of cattle displaying BSE symptoms and needing to be destroyed. This posed a new question: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are making their way into the food chain?\" Government responses at the time were inadequate; the statement \"our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten\" was seen as a vague reassurance that did little to clarify the issue and, in fact, raised suspicion. \n\nRecent documentaries and media reports have further exacerbated this issue. They revealed that infected animals were indeed being sent for slaughter and that safety precautions were inadequate, leading to BSE-tainted beef entering the market. Government denials only made matters worse, creating an environment of uncertainty and risk aversion. Given the fact that no one truly knows the extent of the problem or if CJD can be contracted from eating infected beef, many people are unwilling to take the risk, especially considering the recent headlines of small, isolated cases of CJD deaths. \n\nThe rise of vegetarianism, alongside these concerns, has also contributed to the decline in beef consumption. As more individuals adopt plant-based diets, the demand for beef has further decreased. Together, these factors have significantly impacted beef consumption in the U.K., leading to a noticeable shift in dietary habits.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans due to consumption of the infected beef.\nBeef production is a fairly large business in the U.K and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease.\nIt was discovered that British farmers were to blame, due to their various industrial techniques. The disease originally, was carried by chickens. When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat, the remains (bone and organs) were processed to provide a cheep feeding product. Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well. The cows contracted the disease (in a slightly different form) and this was when \"BSE\" first came about.\nThe correct thing to do, would have been to destroy the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation. However, the farmers had money involved and did not. When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef, their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further.\nUnfortunately, unlike the chickens, the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans in their beef.\nThe same industrial techniques are still used today, and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health concious, the sales in beef have decreased.\nIt is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years. And so, some attitudes of the public are: \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\". Another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims. But it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely.\nIt seems that more and more families have opted for chicken, pork or lamb as an alternative.\nIt could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well. If there is a point where supply outweighs demand, farmers will produce less beef and make less money. It is therefore, conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE, or \"Mad Cow Disease,\" which has been discovered to be transmissible to humans via consumption of the infected beef. Given the significant scale of the beef production industry in the U.K., it became essential to investigate this relatively new disease. It was found that British farmers were at fault due to their industrial techniques. Initially, the disease was carried by chickens. When the farmers slaughtered chickens for meat, the remains (bones and organs) were processed into a cheap feeding product. Unfortunately, not only were these infected parts fed back to more chickens, but they were also given to cows, leading to the development of a slightly different form of the disease known as BSE. \n\nHad the infected cows been destroyed, the situation might have been contained. However, driven by financial gain, many farmers did not take this necessary action. Once the BSE-infected cows were slaughtered and processed, their remains were fed back to other cattle, further spreading the disease. Unlike chickens, cattle could transmit the disease to humans through their beef.\n\nThe same industrial practices persist today. With increasing health consciousness among the UK population due to awareness of these facts, beef sales have decreased. It takes up to seven years for individuals to show symptoms after contracting BSE. This long incubation period has led to various public attitudes. Some people believe that it is too late to change their eating habits since they could already have the disease. Others ignore warnings because no victims have been reported. However, many are choosing to play it safe and avoid beef completely.\n\nAs a result, more families are opting for chicken, pork, or lamb as alternatives. The agricultural industry could face devastating consequences if supply outpaces demand. If farmers reduce beef production due to decreased sales, they may shift to alternative products to ensure profitability.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.\nThe reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.\nIf these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers this would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and know nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.\nI personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government. The government wants to be self-sufficient, and also keep unemployment as low as possible, so the government will start to buy up surpluses. <figure> In this situation, at price P, more is supplied, than demanded, but this intervention price means that the farmers can produce what they like, as they get to sell their surplus anyway.\nAll this will do for the agricultural industry is ensure farmers can predict their income for the next year. This is because once these \"price-support schemes\" are started, they are very difficult to take down again.\nIn conclusion, although this is a dangerous disease that may be contractable, the agricultural industry will not fall by as greater degree as anticipated.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Recently, the consumption of beef in the UK has fallen dramatically, leading to significant problems for both beef farmers and the economy as a whole. The primary reason for this decline is \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE, a disease that affects the cerebral cortex of cows' brains. Due to the uncertainty surrounding a possible human equivalent called Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), the public's fear and subsequent shift towards substitutes have dramatically decreased beef demand. This drop in demand has not only reduced prices but has also plunged many farmers into financial distress.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the original price and quantity demanded are significantly greater than in Figure 2, where a fall in demand has led to a price cut. If this trend continues, many farmers are at risk of going out of business and facing unemployment. For farmers who have dedicated their lives to beef farming, this could be catastrophic. In areas with marginal land, the loss of these skilled workers could lead to an unskilled and aging population.\n\nHowever, I believe that the agricultural industry will not collapse due to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and government price support mechanisms. The government aims to achieve self-sufficiency and minimize unemployment by purchasing surpluses. As depicted in the figure, even when more is supplied than demanded, the intervention price ensures that farmers can still generate income from their production. This system will enable farmers to predict their income for the next year, although it may make it challenging to dismantle these price-support schemes in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat of a human equivalent of BSE is a serious concern, the agricultural industry is likely to weather this storm due to government support measures. These policies will help maintain stability in the sector, ensuring that farmers can continue to produce and earn a livelihood.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Scenes of calves in these crates or of protests (in which one protester has been killed) at the ports both on television or in newspapers may have persuaded people to either become vegetarian or at least stop eating beef.

In 1994 a cluster of cases of streptercoccus bacteria that devoured human beings was claimed to be an epidemic, and in the next week 1000's of people went to their local G.P claiming to have contracted this disease.\nThese are two main factors in why some UK residents belive that eating beef may have adverse effects on them. They belive exactly what the media tells them.\n'Mad cow disease', which turns a cows' brain into a spongy semi-liquid, has been reported by the media, primarily tabloids, to be contagious to people who eat this meat. Documentaries, ITN & BBC news, and gossip have spread this claim throughout the UK frightening some people into not eating beef.\nThis is the main reason for a sudden decline in beef eating, other contributry<?> factors may include; increasing vegetarians & people on a low fat diet but these factors won't be any where near as significant.\nThe agricultural industry will contain a substantial amount of cattle that should be slaughted for meat. Any farmer that keeps a significant number of cattle is likely to strongly rely financially on the selling of beef.\nBecause this swing in 'public taste' of beef was so sudden dairy farmer are likely to be stuck with cattle they cannot sell. If there is no demand for a product there is little point in producing it and so if there is less demand for beef there will be less farmers with cattle for slaughter.\nAlthough so far the industry claims the drop in meat consumption by the public is due to seasonal tastes and many farmer have sat the low prices out, there is no indication of a pick up in the market.\nEventually the decrease in cattle being produced for slaughter will feed back on an supplier of cattle materials such as feed (if not grass feed) or services such as slaughter houses.\nSome subsidy system from the government may be established to encourage the farmers but this will only attack the symptoms not the cause; the UK public willing to belive the worst.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The public in the UK reads newspapers daily, and this constant exposure has shaped their beliefs and behaviors. In 1994, a series of cases involving streptococcus bacteria, which had reportedly devoured human beings, led thousands of people to visit their GPs, convinced that they had contracted the disease. These events, along with media reports, have significantly contributed to the belief that eating beef can have adverse effects on health.\n\n'Mad cow disease,' a condition that renders a cow's brain a spongy, semi-liquid state, has been a primary focus of media coverage. Tabloids, documentaries, and news channels have reported this disease as potentially contagious to humans who consume beef. This alarming information has spread fear among many UK residents, leading to a noticeable decline in beef consumption.\n\nWhile other factors such as an increase in vegetarians and those opting for a low-fat diet have played a role, the media's influence remains the most significant contributor to this shift. A sudden drop in beef consumption poses a severe challenge for the agricultural industry, especially for dairy farmers who heavily rely on selling beef. The sudden change in consumer preferences means that farmers may be left with unsold cattle, leading to financial strain and potentially decreased production.\n\nIf the demand for beef remains low, the agricultural sector will experience further repercussions. Slaughterhouses and feed suppliers may suffer, and without a significant uptick in demand, fewer farmers will continue to produce beef at current prices. Despite the industry's claims that the decline is due to seasonal tastes and lower prices, there is no indication of an improving market.\n\nIn the long term, a reduction in cattle for slaughter will affect the entire supply chain. The government might implement a subsidy system to support farmers, but this would merely address the symptoms rather than the underlying belief that beef consumption is risky. Until the public's perception changes, the agricultural industry will continue to face significant challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's portrayal of 'mad cow disease' has had a profound impact on public health beliefs and behaviors, leading to a decline in beef consumption. Addressing this issue requires not only economic support but also a concerted effort to correct misinformation and restore public trust in beef.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) involves the fertilisation of an egg in a laboratory, often in a test tube, where it is then placed in an environment optimised for fertilisation by sperm from the father. Once fertilisation occurs, the resulting fertilised egg, or embryo, is implanted back into the mother's womb, where it continues to develop normally. Typically, more than one egg is retrieved from the mother to increase the chances of successful fertilisation and to provide options in case the initial attempt is unsuccessful, leading to a higher likelihood of multiple births such as twins or triplets.\n\nThere are those who oppose IVF, viewing it as unnatural and arguing that starting life in a test tube is unfair to the child. This perspective is grounded in the belief that life begins at the moment of conception. Ethical considerations arise concerning who should receive IVF and who should be excluded, at what age IVF should no longer be offered, and whether the significant costs of IVF should be justified when the same funds could potentially save hundreds of lives by vaccinating against diseases such as measles.\n\nProponents of IVF argue that it is a fundamental right for individuals to have their own biological children. IVF offers hope to women who cannot conceive naturally due to medical issues, such as blocked fallopian tubes. These women should not be denied the opportunity to have children through no fault of their own.\n\nAs technology advances rapidly, it has outpaced the development of ethics and practical guidelines. It is imperative to establish certain regulations to govern the use of IVF. For instance, fertility treatments should not be provided to post-menopausal women. The menopause is a natural biological process indicating that the body is no longer capable of bearing a child. Last year, a case involving a post-menopausal woman who falsely claimed her age to obtain IVF highlights the need for stringent measures to prevent such occurrences.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

The sperm of the egg of the two partners are removed and they are then fused together in the 'test tube' hence the term test tube baby.\n\tAs the law stands it is possible for this treatment to be carried out in the U.K. and the first baby girls was born in 1978. The moral dilemma surrounding this is, is it an acceptable start to the babys life to begin in a test tube and not <  ? > intended, inside the mother? Will it damage the baby in any way? and could society become to dependant on this method of fertilisation?\n\tFertility treatment for post-menopausal women. When women start menopause is it natures way of saying the body is not a suitable host to a new life? Not necessarily. Women now can have the treatment, successfully, and give birth to healthy children late on in life. Although some British doctors disapproved of such methods this treatment is easily found abroad. The desire to have children is so great mothers can pay thousands of pounds in the hope they may concieve. I find this to be a difficult issue to agree or oppose as only being young and having my life ahead it is quite easy to say that it is disgraceful women of late 50's having children and they had their chance and they let it go but if at fifty and maybe you put your career first all your life and now want a family should you not be given the chance and is it not how old you are but what kind of a mother you would be? I think that I would like to see a change in the law to allow women to have children if they feel able to cope but I feel if legalised it would be a decision taken to freely by women and not taking into consideration the consequences. At twelve years old the mother could be near seventy and is this really the age to bring up a teenager? The resentment, bullying and communication barrier between the child and mother could cause numerous problems. I think if legalised and offered to women it would need some kind of councilling and assessment as each case is individual.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the process of fertilising an egg outside the mother's body in a laboratory environment. The sperm and egg of the two partners are combined in a 'test tube,' hence the term 'test tube baby.' Currently, this procedure is legally permitted in the UK, with the first successful birth of a test tube baby occurring in 1978. The moral debate surrounding IVF revolves around whether beginning a baby's life in a test tube and not in the mother's body is acceptable. Additionally, concerns arise about potential damage to the baby and the potential for society to become overly dependent on this method of fertilisation.\n\nAnother aspect of IVF is its application for post-menopausal women. Menopause is often seen as the natural end to a woman's fertility, but the reality is that women can still successfully conceive and give birth later in life. Despite some initial disapproval from British doctors, fertility treatments for post-menopausal women are now widely available abroad. The desire to have children is so strong that women are willing to spend thousands of pounds on these treatments in the hopes of conceiving. This issue is particularly challenging to judge; while it might seem disgraceful for women in their late 50s to have children, what about those who prioritised their careers and now want to start a family? Should age be the sole factor in determining whether a woman can have a child? I believe that it's more about what kind of mother she would be and whether she feels capable of handling the responsibilities.\n\nThe legalisation and availability of IVF for post-menopausal women raise several ethical concerns. For instance, if IVF were to be legalised, how would we ensure that women are fully aware of the potential risks and consequences? What about the psychological impact of a mother being near 70 when giving birth? The resentment, bullying, and communication barriers between the child and the mother could lead to numerous problems. Therefore, if IVF were to be legalised and made more accessible, it would need to be accompanied by comprehensive psychological assessments and counselling for both the mother and the child. Each case would require individual evaluation to ensure that the mother is emotionally and mentally prepared for the challenges of motherhood, especially at advanced ages.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed. People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants, there are many complications but many are succesful. People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.\n\tBodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Science has made tremendous strides since the 19th century, transforming the medical landscape with numerous inventions and advancements. People in our modern era can now undergo liver, heart, and even lung transplants, despite the complications that often arise. Additionally, those with insufficient blood requirements can receive a new blood supply, and individuals with a shortage of white blood cells can undergo bone marrow transplants. All of these operations are performed on living individuals, yet contemporary biological techniques allow for procedures even on those not yet born, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nWith IVF, an egg is extracted from a woman and placed in a test tube, where it is then fertilized by sperm. The resulting embryo is incubated in the test tube for a few weeks before being transferred back into the mother, where it can develop naturally. This method is incredibly beneficial for married couples who have been unsuccessful in conceiving, as it allows the baby to grow inside the mother, fostering natural bonding between mother and child. While adopting offers an alternative, it lacks the intimate and natural connection that an IVF-birth provides. However, I find it ethically problematic when a post-menopausal woman chooses to undergo IVF. Nature has already concluded that she is too old to conceive naturally, so why should she be granted this intervention? This decision is not fair to the child, who, when it grows up, might face the stark contrast of having friends with parents in their 30s and 40s while its own parents may be drawing pensions. Furthermore, the mother might die before the child has led a full life, which would be unfair to the child. The child might also be burdened with the responsibility of caring for an aging mother.\n\nAs the embryo begins its life in a test tube, the selection of sperm is possible, which allows for the choice of the baby's sex. This can be achieved through genetic selection, where the sex of the sperm is determined, and only sperm of the desired sex is used for fertilization.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

IVF has been around for over a decade and still is the centre of difficulties and conflicts. IVF pushes all parties involved with to the limit, morally, legally and ethically.\n\tThe first argument is that of the parents. These people can be like anyother healthy, successful etc. but infertile. Should they have the right to 'buy' themselves a baby? I think so. If they can afford the treatment and deal with the issues surrounding it, then they should go ahead. A child will make them happy and feel complete as a family and everyone has the right to feel that. Those with less money, however either have to not bother, take years saving up or adopt - but this is not the same as having your own biological baby.\n\tProblems which may arise for the parents are mainly the chances of the treatment being unsuccessful. This can be a major disappointment especially if the couple have spent all their savings on the treatment. They could even get into debt if they wanted to try again. There is the ethical issue if on finding out if the baby will be deformed or mentally ill in anyway whether to abort the foetus or not.\n\tFertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of the most controversial issues when discussing IVF. They have their own personal reasons for why they want a baby at that stage of life. Most people disagree with it from the start without even hearing the argument from the mother. This is because they probably see it as unnatural to continue (or <?> having children when the body is not biologically prepared for it. Personally, I think that this is only acceptable when the woman has married or wants to start a family with a younger partner. This is where the rights of the child comes in.\n\tIf the parents are still relitavely young, then the child will in most cases have a reasonable quality of life. If a post menopausal woman has a child then in a very high majority of cases she will be at least 45-50 years of age and will be an O.A.P.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of many treatments associated with complex medical, ethical, and legal challenges. Though IVF has been available for over a decade, it continues to push all parties involved\u2014physicians, patients, and society\u2014to the limits. One of the primary ethical concerns revolves around the rights and responsibilities of the parents. These parents, who may be otherwise healthy and successful, are often infertile. Should they have the right to 'buy' a child? In my view, if they can afford the treatment and are willing to deal with the associated challenges, they should be allowed to proceed. A child can provide them with a sense of completeness and happiness, a fundamental human right. However, individuals with less financial means are often left with the difficult choice of not pursuing treatment, saving for years, or adopting\u2014each option with its own drawbacks, but none offering the same personal satisfaction as having a biological child.\n\nAnother significant issue in IVF is the risk of treatment failure. Couples who have invested significant time and resources into IVF can face the heartbreak of unsuccessful procedures. Financially, they might end up in debt, particularly if multiple attempts are needed. Ethically, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy after discovering potential deformities or mental health issues further complicates the process.\n\nFertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of the most controversial aspects of IVF. Despite personal reasons for wanting to have a child, many oppose the practice outright. This opposition is often rooted in the perception that it is unnatural for a woman to continue having children beyond her biological prime. While I understand the rationale, I believe that in cases where the woman is married or wishes to start a family with a younger partner, it could be ethically permissible. The rights of the child are paramount in these situations, ensuring that the child is born into a stable and nurturing environment.\n\nIf the parents are still relatively young, the child is likely to have a reasonable quality of life. Conversely, if a post-menopausal woman has a child, she will typically be at least 45-50 years old and well into her senior years. This raises concerns about the long-term care the child might require and the potential financial and emotional burdens on the mother. Therefore, the ethical considerations surrounding post-menopausal IVF are indeed complex and multifaceted, requiring careful thought and balanced decision-making.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

An egg, is taken from the womans ovaries and sperm is produced by the male under controlled conditions. They will hopefully be fertilized and a embroyo will start to grow. The embroyo will then be placed in the womens womb where it is hoped that a normal pregnancy will take place.\n\tThere are obviously many moral dilemmas for and against this issue. I shall look at firstly the advantages of in vitro fertilization treatment.\n\tThe treatment if successful will make the male and female involved very happy. They have always wanted to have a child and now they have one. A dilemma, which may arise here, is have the parents the right to have a second child through IVF treatment.\n\tUnfortunatly, the disadvantages of IVF treatment largely outweigh the advantages. Huge sums of money are involved in this treatment, as it can only be done very rarely on the National Health Service. Normally, the couple have to come up with the money themselves and perhaps it can be even said that they are buying a child. Money which perhaps some couples don't have. The treatment may take many years to work with an enormous cost.\n\tThe financial hardship and the constant disappointment may also put a strain on what used to be an ideal marriage.\nThe doctors who carry out this treatment are currently making a lot of money from it, is this right?\n\tIn my opinion, there should be some regulations. Lets look at a) fertility treatment for post-menopausal women. Unless, there is a resonnable argument for example, early menopause taking place there should be some regulations. If a women goes for this treatment, and has a baby when she is 55 what kind of life will that child have? When, it reaches its early teens the mother will be nearly 70. I think that there should be an age limit on fertility treatment. But, if the couple are funding the venture privatly this would be hard to stop. It would be important though to look at, what type of quality of life would the child lead?\nIn some especially, earlier on in the days of treatment multiple births took place. A women would give birth to 7 babies not just one.

I will first examine the advantages of IVF treatment.\n\nThe treatment, if successful, brings immense happiness to the male and female involved. They have always desired to have a child and are now able to do so. However, a significant moral dilemma arises: do the parents have the right to use IVF for a second child? This raises ethical questions about the limits of parental rights and the well-being of future siblings.\n\nUnfortunately, the disadvantages of IVF treatment largely outweigh the advantages. The process is costly, and couples often have to finance it themselves, making it financially inaccessible for many. The cost can be so high that some couples might consider it an expensive commodity, potentially leading to the \"buying\" of a child. Additionally, the IVF process can be lengthy and fraught with disappointment, which may place a significant strain on the marital relationship.\n\nMoreover, the financial hardship and emotional stress associated with IVF can be overwhelming. The doctors who perform these treatments are also profiting from the procedure, raising questions about the ethical implications of their financial gain.\n\nIn my opinion, regulations should be implemented to mitigate some of these issues. For instance, fertility treatment for post-menopausal women should be strictly regulated. Unless there is a reasonable argument, such as early menopause, there should be age limits on fertility treatment. For example, a woman going through IVF at the age of 55 would have to consider the long-term implications for her child, including the mother\u2019s advanced age when the child reaches adolescence. If the couple funds the treatment privately, it would be challenging to enforce these regulations, but the quality of life for the potential child should still be a primary concern.\n\nAdditionally, earlier in the history of IVF, multiple births were more common, often resulting in seven or more babies.

In vitro ie. in a natural environment.\nThis gives couples who could not naturally have children the ability to have their own family without adopting.\na) Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women enables parents to start a family later in life. This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged to have children for her partner. Having a child is stressful at any age but if the mother is older when the child very young she may not have the energy to get up four times every night etc.\n\tTherefore, although I agree with fertility treatment for post menopausal women I think that upper age limits should be applied. Also, I think the women should have a form of councelling before hand so that they are aware of how much more stressful it is to bring up children later in life.\nb) Sex Selection.\n\tThis form of genetic engineering allows the parents to choose their own child. Therefore, couples who only want boys could do so. However, if a couple could only love one gender of child should they have one? Although in principle the idea of choosing children is not a bad one, where would it stop? If this is acceptable then choosing blonde hair and blue eyes may also become acceptable. This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the parents may find it hard to love the child.

Moreover, older mothers may feel pressurized to have children for their partners, which can add stress to their lives.\n\nTherefore, while I support fertility treatment for post-menopausal women, I believe that upper age limits should be established. Additionally, I suggest that women undergo counseling before the treatment to help them understand the significant additional stress involved in raising children later in life.\n\nSex selection is another form of genetic engineering that allows parents to choose the sex of their child. For example, couples who prefer only boys could opt for this procedure. However, if a couple can only love one gender of child, should they have one? While the idea of choosing a child's gender is not inherently bad, the potential for misuse is significant. If sex selection is accepted, it might lead to other choices such as selecting physical traits like hair color and eye color, which could alter the population's makeup. Furthermore, if the treatment results in the wrong gender being conceived, parents might struggle to love the child. In countries like China, where the one-child policy has been in place, the practice of sex selection has unfortunately led to the neglect and killing of many baby girls, driven by the desire for sons.", "speed": 0.4437197508931945, "eta": "00h02m26s"}

In particular, the phrase is applied to foetuses concieved outside of the female body which is then transferred to the womb. Whilst many feel that it is every persons right to have a child if they wish, many others feel that it is unnatural and therefore wrong to concieve a child in this manner and that there are other alternatives available, for example, adoption.\n\tIn recent years there has been much heated discussion had over the right for post-menopausal women to have a child. One such case involved a woman in her sixties having to travel to an Italian clinic so that she could concieve a baby. Whilst it is understandable that this woman would want a child of her own, it seems hardly fair on her future offspring. Although the woman in question was healthy at the time of conception it is possible that her health may quickly deteriorate in only a short time and therefore the child would be left with an incapable mother, or in fact no mother at all. The health risks too the child whilst in the womb are numerous and as well as this, moral issues are raised. This is a highly unnatural occurrence which takes away part of the 'miricle' of child birth and makes it seem as though life can be manufactured. It is easy to understand why a post-menopausal woman would want a child to care for in retirement years especially if she or her partner had no child of their own but I personally feel that it should not be allowed as it does not only seem unethical but the practical disadvantages far outweigh any advantages.\n\tAt this present time, sex selection before conception is unreliable with many experts thinking that it is not possible. However the see of a foetus may be discovered after the child has been concieved and therefore if it is the 'wrong' sex, the foetus may be aborted.

While many advocate that everyone has the right to have a child, others argue that IVF is unnatural and morally wrong, pointing to alternative options like adoption.\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant debate over the right of post-menopausal women to have children. A notable case involved a woman in her sixties who had to travel to an Italian clinic to conceive. Although she desired a child, the situation raises concerns about the potential risks and moral implications. While her health was favorable at the time of conception, her future health could decline rapidly, leaving her child with an incapable mother or no mother at all. Additionally, the health risks to the child during pregnancy are substantial. Moreover, the process of IVF is seen as highly unnatural, stripping away the miraculous nature of childbirth and implying that life can be manufactured. While a post-menopausal woman might seek a child to care for in her retirement, especially if she has no children of her own, I believe such procedures should not be allowed. The ethical concerns and practical disadvantages far outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nCurrently, sex selection before conception is unreliable, and many experts believe it is not possible. However, if the sex of a foetus can be detected after conception, the option to abort a \"wrong\" sex foetus becomes a contentious issue. Although this appears harsh and selfish, it is difficult to impose restrictions. While the idea of terminating an innocent life is distressing, in some cases, abortion may be the only viable option. Therefore, imposing a ban on such practices might be unjust.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

As more genes are `mapped' we find out more about the way our life is defined.\n\tMost people believe that the ability to erase genetic `flaws' is a good thing, but the key to the problem is knowing when to stop. I believe that in some areas there may be a case for genetic manipulation, for example the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which has been shown to have genetic links. By genetic manipulation many hereditary degenerative diseases could be wiped out, but would people be satisfied with that?\n\tAnother `disease' with proven genetic links is Manic Depression. Perhaps people could have a better standard of life if there was no manic depression, but to tamper here is to tamper with the human mind. The real question is where the line is drawn between a flawed personality and an individual personality. If we are to stop the human race including depressives, is it really such a big step to get rid of people with other awkward character traits from `grumps' through environmental activists to radical polititions. Obviously the traits of such people are not wholly genetic, but there must be some genetic influence in the way their minds work.\n\tAny scientist who works in genetics must seriously consider the implications of the work he does, as must any person who works at the forefront of any field. These days this is becoming increasingly important in science, as the general populace begins to believe in its infaliability. It can be argued that scientists only make discoveries, and it is others who misuse their work; Marie Curie could not have forseen the nuclear threat of the cold war as she worked with radioactive samples.

I will also discuss the potential benefits and harmful aspects of genetic manipulation or genetic engineering.\n\tGenetic manipulation and gene technology is a vast field of study and it is growing increasingly larger, which is why we need to monitor its progress in order to limit the size of any potential damage. Scientists in this area must bear the burden of moral responsibility, simply because the high technology levels allow them to have the ability to create potential world diasasters. At the momentic it is possible to insert genes of 1 organism into another, allowing for mutations of animals with altered genes. I predict that in the near future, this will cross into human biology, and that it will soon be able to alter physical characteristics of unborn babies, as well as even psychological alteration. The moral implications of this are huge, and as it is a scientific creation, then scientists must be held responsible for their actions. An example of irresponsible behavior in this area, in recent times was the introduction of cancer cells into normal everyday flu viruses, by a team of scientists in America. The military will no doubt be involved in gene technology, and scientists must be held responsible for the weapons they will no doubt create using genetic manipulation.\n\tOf course the technology does have beneficial effects. Its is now possible to grow human cartilage in the shape of an ear, which will not be rejected by the patients body. This will surely lead to the growth of organs, artificially. Genetic engineering was responsible for artificial insulin and the special factor VII for people with blood diseases. Genetic engineering has also been responsible for the creation of new types of plants (eg rice) which give much higher harvest yields, and this is especially useful in third world countries.\n\tTherefore in conclusion I must agree with the original statement because whilst gene scientists could solve many of the worlds problems, they could create just as many.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I must start by stating that I totally agree with the proposition that \"Scientists must bear the major burden of moral responsibility for the consequences of their work.\" This perspective underscores the critical role scientists play in ensuring that the benefits of their research are maximized while minimizing potential harms. Genetic manipulation and gene technology is a vast and rapidly expanding field of study, which is why it is essential to monitor its progress to limit any potential damage. Scientists in this area must bear the burden of moral responsibility, given the high technology levels that allow them to create potential world disasters.\n\nCurrently, genetic manipulation enables the insertion of genes from one organism into another, leading to mutations in animals with altered genes. As we move forward, this technology is poised to extend into human biology, potentially altering physical characteristics of unborn babies and even introducing psychological changes. The moral implications of these advancements are substantial, and as these are scientific creations, scientists must be held accountable for their actions. For instance, in recent times, a team of scientists in the United States introduced cancer cells into normal flu viruses, highlighting the potential for irresponsible behavior in this field. Additionally, with military involvement likely in gene technology, scientists must be held responsible for the genetic weapons they might develop.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that genetic engineering also holds significant potential for beneficial effects. For example, it is now possible to grow human cartilage in the shape of an ear, which will not be rejected by the patient's body. This advancement is expected to lead to the development of artificial organs, which could revolutionize organ transplantation. Genetic engineering has also been responsible for the creation of artificial insulin and special factor VII for people with blood diseases, greatly improving the quality of life for those afflicted. Moreover, genetic engineering has led to the development of new types of plants, such as rice, which yield higher harvests\u2014especially beneficial in third-world countries.\n\nIn conclusion, while genetic scientists have the potential to solve many of the world's problems, they must also be prepared to address the potential for creating significant issues.

The research in the last decade or so has made unbelievable progress at every turn, not all of it 'morally viable', so to speak. The theory that scientists should take responsibility for their work and its consequences is an interesting idea but there is one basic function of human psychology that makes this hypothesis invalid; when an individual scientist is working on research they are almost always working under sponsorship or directly working for a company. This means that any responsibility he/she may feel for his/her actions is shifted to their employers/sponsors. This effect has been studied for many years and several well-documented experiments show the effect clearly. It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face. Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in ww2 again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentration camps and saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sense of immediacy of the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.\n\tThis is all very interesting you may say, but these geneticists must feel some moral obligation. The actual work of genetic engineering is constantly coming up for discussion in today's media world and the work of many leading laboratories has been recognised as useful and moralistic. For example the production of insulin by genetic engineering is undoubtedly a laudable use of scientific knowledge, also the production of high yield crops for third world countries, another useful facet of genetic control. But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound? For example the high yield crops; they do indeed give many times the harvest of a normal variety yet several leach the soil, require very careful use of oil based fertilisers and countless other minor adjustments.

These include: the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high-yield crops. There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society.\n\tHowever, many people dislike or are prejudiced against, genetic manipulation. Partly this is a 'Fear of the unknown'; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people, and therefore provokes fear. What people have also become aware of, is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals. This has been very good to feed popular culture (the film 'Jurassic Park' being an obvious reference point). There is also however, the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for `evil' purposes. This then, is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work.\n\tAnything in life can be misused. Whether it be a kitchen-knife used to stab someone, a car used to run someone over, or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate. Everything in life, if misused, can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception. Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen-knife or car, this is purely a subjective view by present-day standards. Certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen-knife responsible for their misuse, and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse.\n\tThe fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work, is that if this had been applied universally for centuries, scientific research would never have taken place, and mankind would be without electricity, radios, quite simply, anything above the mud hut' existence. Scientific research is not a corrupt, but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself. The other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility, Science is a process of discovery rather than creation, ie. no-one created genetic manipulation, the power of it was there to be discovered.

Is it the blind persuit of knowledge and the discovery of the unknown, or is it to inplement and use the ideas and discoverys of his own, or of others. In my opinion the answer to this question is the former, a scientist uncovers what is unknown. The latter lies more in the relms of business.\n\tI would consider it difficult for a scientist to shoulder the responsibility for his or her work, if his discoveries were implemented by others, for example, could Einstin, one of the greatest scientests of the 20th century, be held responsible for the development of the atom bomb, or more reacently, the catastrophies at three mile island or at chenobyl. Einsteins work layed down the theoretical basis for nuclear weapons, and the implementation of the nuclear weapons program provided the catalyst for the development of nuclear electricity generation. can we blame Einstein for this.\n\tThis brings out several points: in a non money motivated world it is highly likely that if one scientist forsees dangers of his discoveries, he will discontinue it, he cannot however prevent others continuing his work, and he cannot ensure that the disoveries will not be made by others. In the real money motivated world, these are two pressures pushing him to continue his work, money being the most important: if he sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to contue his work. The other pressure is fame and the delight in being <?>. There are thousands of scientists who have achieved imortality through their work. All of this argument depends on the scientist seeing the potential dangers on his work. However, very often the scientist is blind to all the effects that his work may have. They often have an aim, a potential use for his work: it is likely that other implementations of his work are likely, and for the scientist difficult to see.\n\tAlso, how can a scientist take moral responsibility for a discovery made by pure luck. take this extreem example: a chemical researcher deliberately, without knowledge of its effects, mixes chemicals which result in the production of an unknown but deadly <?> gas which kills the entire staff of his research department.

In a non-monetarily motivated world, if a scientist foresees the dangers of his discoveries, he is likely to discontinue them. However, he cannot prevent others from continuing his work, and he cannot ensure that discoveries will not be made by others. In the real, money-driven world, two pressures push scientists to continue their work: the most significant is money. If a scientist sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to continue his work. The other pressure is fame and the delight in making a significant contribution to the field. There are thousands of scientists who have achieved immortality through their work.\n\nHowever, this argument depends on the scientist seeing the potential dangers of his work. Often, scientists are blind to all the effects their work may have. They usually have a specific aim, a potential use for their work, and other implementations are likely, making it difficult for the scientist to foresee all possibilities.\n\nMoreover, how can a scientist take moral responsibility for a discovery made by pure luck? Consider this extreme example: a chemical researcher deliberately mixes chemicals without knowledge of its effects, and the result is the production of an unknown but deadly gas that kills the entire research department. As the scientist is not at the forefront of his science, the death of his colleagues is not his fault. Yet, the implications of this accidental discovery raise questions about the broader moral and ethical responsibilities of scientists.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This technique has been of great benefit to the human race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.\n\tIt is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides. This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for any later events.\n\tToday, much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work on this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.\n\tWhere scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes. These are now available in a supermarket near you, with their genes altered to increase their redness, juiciness or resistance to disease. These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe, but if they, or some other genically engineered food, proves to cause a terrible disease, than that is the fault of the scientist who developed them, because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side-effects, that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market, and the scientists are to blame.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Genetic manipulation has been an integral part of human history, dating back to centuries of selective breeding in crops and animals.

Scientists working in this field cannot be held accountable if their techniques are exploited for less altruistic purposes, such as biological warfare or the elimination of perceived undesirable genetic traits in embryos.\n\nNevertheless, scientists can be held responsible in certain circumstances. For example, genetically engineered tomatoes that are now available in supermarkets, with their genes modified to enhance redness, juiciness, or disease resistance, are likely safe. However, if such genetically engineered foods later cause severe health issues, the blame would fall on the scientists who developed them, as they should have conducted thorough safety tests. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medicines prove to have harmful side effects, it would indicate a failure in pre-market testing, and the scientists involved would be accountable for this oversight.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

Eventually it will be possible to eliminate genetically in herited diseases such as haemophillia and cistic fibrosis. This will be done by mapping the entire human genome. This will enable scientists to know precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.\n\tGenetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids for circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.\n\tGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a very simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need.\n\tCrops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to draught, pests and disease.\n\tIn the future it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. This is immoral as superhumans would be created for specific jobs for example huge men with lots of muscle small heads and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or for boxing.\n\tScientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal. This should not include mental ability as this would also be immoral. Genetic manipulation should not be used to change normal humans into superhumans.\n\tIt must be scientists to bear the burden as these are the people who have the knowledge to create the superhumans.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Genetic Manipulation is the medicine of the future, poised to revolutionize medical treatment and enhance human capabilities.

For instance, insulin production relies on inserting the human insulin gene into plasmids, circular loops of DNA found in bacteria. Additionally, an antibiotic resistance gene is included, which eliminates other bacteria, leaving behind those containing the insulin gene. These bacteria multiply, producing insulin throughout their lives. This process is preferable to the traditional method of grinding down cow's livers. Such genetic engineering techniques are invaluable in treating certain diseases and conditions, allowing affected individuals to lead relatively normal, healthy lives.\n\nGenetic manipulation has also been widely applied in food production. Selective breeding, a straightforward example, has been used for decades to enhance milk production in cows. By breeding cows with high milk production due to a genetic defect, subsequent generations yield significantly more milk than their ancestors. Similarly, crops have been engineered to boost yields and enhance resistance to drought, pests, and disease, demonstrating the practical benefits of genetic manipulation.\n\nLooking to the future, genetic manipulation may allow for the alteration of human physical and mental abilities. While this capability could be harnessed for seemingly beneficial purposes, such as creating \"superhumans\" for specific jobs, it raises significant ethical concerns. For instance, developing \"huge men with lots of muscle, small heads, and organs tucked away\" as fighting machines for war or boxing would be both unethical and morally reprehensible.\n\nScientists will undoubtedly have the knowledge and capability to create such superhumans, making it imperative that strict controls are put in place. Genetic engineering and manipulation should be reserved for improving the lives of disadvantaged individuals, rather than for enhancing normal humans. Importantly, such enhancements should not include mental abilities, as altering this aspect would also be immoral.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility falls on scientists to wield this powerful technology responsibly, ensuring that it benefits society as a whole without compromising ethical standards.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and there is a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans. The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, and indeed he may, there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. And indeed this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered. But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon.\n\tWe can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject. But are we right to blame him? Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering. It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask, should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences. Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world? In truth no, it is unreasonable.\n\tGenetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin. The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down's Syndrome. There is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones. Some of these may seem a little far fetched but it is conceivable that in a 100 years time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child, whether he is a great piano player or sportsman.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes, ranging from disease treatment to enhanced agricultural productivity.

This uncertainty fuels a fear of the unexpected, which is indeed justified. Just as the nuclear holocaust serves as a grim reminder of the potential for unforeseen consequences, similar concerns arise with genetic engineering.\n\nWe can argue that scientists, being experts in their fields, should have a deep understanding of both the potential benefits and risks of their discoveries. However, can we truly hold them accountable for the broader implications of their work? For instance, consider the scenario where a scientist discovers a cure for cancer through genetic engineering. Would it be fair to expect them to halt their research and consider the potential long-term effects, even if they are not 100% certain? It is unreasonable to demand that they bear the burden of ensuring the global welfare through their discoveries.\n\nGenetic engineering is advancing rapidly.

The possibilities are endless, a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry, hot conditions of many third world countries, relieving them of their worries of starvation. Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people's resistance to them. Of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists. Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents and gardeners cross breed plants to suit their individual needs.\n\tHowever, their is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation. The advantages seem very favourable and I'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for these. But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation?\n\tThere are many possibilities for the misuse of this process. One is a question of ethics and morals. Is it right to try and change motive? Is it the right of one man to play God?\n\tIt is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering. A new plant which has an increased growthrate may seem like an answer to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem, draining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow? In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area such as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal, it my not be possible to find a solution.\n\tAnother problem would be the process of testing.

Similarly, cattle could be bred to more efficiently convert plant energy into body mass, or genetic modifications could be made to render certain diseases non-threatening.

While the advantages appear favorable, and a scientist might take credit for these, they might also be held responsible for the myriad disadvantages that may arise. The process of genetic mutation opens up numerous possibilities for misuse, one of which is ethical and moral. Is it right to attempt to alter an organism's fundamental nature? Is it within the realm of a single individual to play the role of a deity?\n\nMoreover, the unpredictability of new organisms created through genetic engineering poses a significant challenge. A plant engineered to grow faster might seem like a solution to our problems, but what if it disrupts the ecosystem by depleting soil nutrients and preventing other plants from growing? While a scientist may theoretically take responsibility for such outcomes, in the realm of genetic manipulation, where knowledge is still limited, finding a solution might prove impossible.\n\nAnother concern lies in the process of genetic testing. We are nearing the point where it is feasible to test individuals' genetic makeup to predict the likelihood of developing certain illnesses.

On the beneficial side, genetic engineering has been used to help maintain and improve the lives of billions of people each day. This is because new species of hybrid plants have been developed, which produce larger harvests and can grow in nutrient-deprived regions or survive with small amounts of water. This means more food is available, which pushes down the price of food, making many people happy as they can spend their money elsewhere. Genetics is also used in another way, such as manipulating flowers for varying colors, which couldn't be done before, for instance, creating a \"black\" rose.\n\nAnimals have also been manipulated for thousands of years, breeding for specific traits such as good milk yields in cattle, ferocity in dogs, or tailless cats. Even in what we drink, alcohol, is produced as a waste product by yeast, which eventually kills itself due to the alcohol. However, yeast has been genetically modified to produce higher concentrations of alcohol, making the process more efficient. The most controversial aspect of genetic manipulation, however, is its application to humans. Is it about eradicating genetic diseases, which would be a good thing, or is it a slippery slope towards creating a homogeneous, perfect society where no one has faults or imperfections?\n\nMany people argue that it is wrong and that we are playing God. They fear that people will select the aspects they want their children to have, resulting in a world where everyone is identical in looks and ideas, eroding individuality. However, I believe that if God didn\u2019t want us to manipulate genes, He would not have given us the brains we have developed, which give us the capabilities to do so. Eradicating diseases is a good idea, but we must ensure that we do not lose individuality in the process.\n\nGenetic warfare is another concerning issue. The creation of \u201csuperhumans\u201d bred for strength, intuition, toughness, and other attributes raises ethical concerns. While we have been indirectly doing this for years through selective training and muscle toning, the genetic modification of humans for these traits takes it to a whole new level. Genetics can be a wonderful tool for good causes, but it could also be used against the good and for self-glorification, which is not its intended purpose.\n\nIn", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This renaisance period was an opportunity for Da Vinci and others to begin to understand the makings of the World around them, in a more logical and ordered way. In a way Da Vinci is a bad example, as he was not a scientist like you might find today, he was driven by many different things, art, mechanics etc. The difference was that in Da Vinci's day and in Faradays' the was so much unknown that any slight discovery would warrant investigation and the formulation of some rule or other.\n\tModern Scientists have much more information, and a greater technology to work that information into better use. Also there are far more scientists who can do this aswell. Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct an indepth study of a single subject and find out all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday there is less need to take everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, and I consider this a good thing, because how else would technology be updated. However this is not to say that I feel Scientists don't have or shouldn't have a certain curiosity about the unknown, or work is a wider field, but the fact that there are far more men discovering far less to uncover, suggests that some specialisation is the next logical step.\n\tAs far as schools and colleges are concerned I think it is very important to study as wide a field as is possible, because concentrating soley on one science closes so many other doors of discovery. Not to mention the fact that the sciences aid each other in understanding more easily and predicting the outcome.\n\tFor this reason I think combined courses are a very good thing. Not only do they create more of interest in science, in a more rounded sense, but also lay a firmer foundation for specialising at a later date.\n\tA combined course such as Biology and Chemistry opens doors to the likes of Biochemistry, genetic engineering and other professions which rely on a more informed background of science. Studying physics and mathematics helps towards mechanical engineering.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the age of Da Vinci, very little was known about the world of science, presenting an opportunity for Renaissance figures like Leonardo da Vinci to begin understanding the world around them in a more logical and ordered way. However, Da Vinci is a somewhat atypical example, as he was not driven solely by scientific curiosity but also by art and mechanics. The difference in their era and that of Michael Faraday was stark: with so much still unknown, any discovery warranted investigation and the formulation of rules.\n\nIn contrast, modern scientists have access to a vast amount of information and advanced technology, along with a much larger number of scientists who can use this information. Consequently, it is now more beneficial to conduct an in-depth study of a single subject and exhaust all possible knowledge about it rather than pursuing brief interests across a wide range of topics. This is because far more has been discovered since the time of Da Vinci and Faraday, meaning there is less need to treat everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more focused on advancing their specialized knowledge, a trend that I consider positive, as it drives technological progress. However, this does not negate the importance of maintaining a certain curiosity about the unknown or working in a broader field. The reality that there are far more scientists uncovering less new ground suggests that specialization is the next logical step.\n\nIn schools and colleges, it is crucial to study as wide a field as possible. Concentrating solely on one science closes many doors of discovery and limits the interdisciplinary benefits that arise from a well-rounded education. Moreover, the sciences support each other, facilitating a deeper understanding and better prediction of outcomes. For this reason, combined courses are a very good idea. Not only do they pique more interest in science by providing a more comprehensive view, but they also lay a strong foundation for specialization at a later stage.\n\nFor instance, a combined course in Biology and Chemistry can open doors to fields such as biochemistry and genetic engineering, which rely on a solid background in both sciences. Similarly, studying Physics and Mathematics is beneficial for those pursuing careers in mechanical engineering. By integrating multiple disciplines, students can develop a more robust understanding of the scientific world and be better prepared for a wide range of career paths.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

The babies produced are often refered to as a 'test tube baby' because they were concieved in a testtube and not in a uterus.\nThere are two ways in which the process can be performed. The first case is if the ovum comes from the 'mother to be', this is usually because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile; if he is infertile a donor's sperm will be used instead. The second case is when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, it is then that a donor's ovum would be used. It is possible that IVF would be used in a case where both these scenarios are combined ie both partners are infertile, although I suspect this may be considered unethical and full of problems.\n\tThis process is full of ethical questions and the rights of all parties, the parents', the donor's and the child's, must be thought out before hand.\nFirstly the rights of the parents; there are two opinions 1) that people should have the right to have children if they want to and if it is possible to give them that chance, they should have it. 2) that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God. Problems may arise if the women was post-menopausal. Should she really be allowed to have children when her body has told ner no? There is also the fact that the parents may later in life, when the child is still young, be unable, physically or mentally look after the child due to old age. Regulations in cases such as this are <?> after all couples with this treatment are being given the chance of child they wouldn't normally have. If they were adopting, it would be out of the question due to their age. An age limit should be set and adhered to, family history should also be looked into the regulations should be as stringent as those for adoption. Sex selection is another issue that affects the rights of the parents. The major query is, do parents have the right to choose the sex of their child?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the process in which an ovum or \"egg\" is taken from a donor and then fertilized with sperm outside of the uterus.

In the first case, if the ovum comes from the \"mother to be,\" it is usually due to her partner's low sperm count or infertility, in which case a donor's sperm would be used. The second case involves a \"mother to be\" who is post-menopausal or infertile, necessitating the use of a donor's ovum. In scenarios where both partners are infertile, IVF may be employed, though ethical concerns and potential complications may arise, making it a sensitive and complex issue.\n\nThis process is fraught with ethical questions, and the rights of all parties involved\u2014the parents, the donor, and the child\u2014must be considered meticulously. First, the rights of the parents: two opposing views exist. On one side, the argument is that people should have the right to have children if they wish, and if it is possible to provide them with that opportunity, they should be allowed to do so. On the other side, there is a concern that doctors should not play God. Ethical dilemmas arise, particularly if a woman is post-menopausal. Should she be allowed to have children when her body has already signaled its refusal? Another issue is the possibility that the parents might, at a later stage, find themselves physically or mentally unable to care for the child due to their advancing age. To address these concerns, stringent regulations should be established and enforced. Given the unique nature of this treatment, regulations should be as stringent as those for adoption. An age limit should be set for recipients, and a thorough examination of their family history should be conducted to ensure that they are capable of providing a suitable environment for the child.\n\nSex selection is another critical issue affecting the rights of the parents. The central question is whether parents should have the right to choose the sex of their child. This decision has broader implications, including the potential for gender imbalance and societal consequences. Ethical guidelines and regulations must be carefully crafted to address these concerns, ensuring that the process remains transparent and fair.\n\nIn conclusion, IVF is a complex and sensitive procedure that raises numerous ethical questions.

The egg can be that of the mother, in the case of blocked fallopian tubes or post-fertility treatment, but is often donated or even taken from an aborted foetus. It is often the only way that people can have children if they are infertile and the moral dilemmas it causes are contentious issues.\n\tIn Vitro fertilisation has given women sho are unable to have children this opportunity. Being declared infertile used to prevent all hope of this and the advance in technology has made many people very happy. It is the whole purpose of our species, in some peoples' view, to reproduce and this discovery has given this opportunity to many more women. However, in respons to this, many people see it as going against nature. This is not natural for fertilisation to take place outside the womb and, in some peoples' views, the whole idea goes against God and nature.

The moral dilemmas it presents, however, are contentious issues.\n\nIVF has opened doors for women who were previously unable to conceive, offering them the opportunity to become mothers. In the past, being declared infertile would have dashed all hopes of motherhood. With advancements in technology, this process has brought immense joy to many. According to some, the very purpose of human existence is to reproduce, and IVF has made this possible for a wider range of women. Conversely, others view IVF as unnatural and even as \"playing God.\" They believe that fertilisation outside the womb goes against nature and, in some cases, even God's will.\n\nWomen who use their own eggs for IVF have every right to do so, as long as the process is ethically and legally permissible. Those who opt for donated eggs, with the consent of the donor, should also be supported. However, egg donation can lead to complications. If an egg is donated by a friend, the donor might want to claim some rights over the child, potentially causing identity issues. For example, a child conceived through IVF might struggle with their identity if the donor is a friend or relative who does not wish to relinquish their rights. This issue is particularly problematic when considering eggs taken from aborted foetuses. A child who knows they came from an aborted foetus might be left with psychological challenges, as the foetus was never technically alive.\n\nThe cost of IVF is another concern. On the NHS, the high costs of IVF treatment could be redirected towards funding more life-saving treatments for those in dire need.

This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today.

This shows the need for a human perception of a problem and the possible ways of solving it. This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one. However, the employment of labour saving devices can be seen as being something that frees the human brain and allows it to contemplate \"higher things\". This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, and indeed it is necessary, to learn more. This is because the opportunity for non-skilled employment is being reduced by the ability to employ machinery.\nThe computer has also served to make the brain redundant, or unused, by the advent of entertainment systems. The almost universal fanaticism of the young, it is also widespread amongst the supposedly more learned adults, for games has led to less employment of the brain. Unless it is to learn to get past level five, a necessary skill for life. This prevents the traditional learning process and wastes time and energy that could be better applied.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "How far and in what ways has the human brain been made redundant by the invention of the computer? The invention of the computer, while immensely useful, still necessitates a human brain to instruct it on its tasks. This underscores the importance of human perception in identifying problems and exploring potential solutions, not just in data input but also in the design and creation of these tools. It was human ingenuity that drove the invention of the computer itself. Although computers excel in measuring events with precision, they remain a mere tool, dependent on human input to realize their potential, particularly in scientific endeavors such as space exploration, where sophisticated instruments like the Hubble telescope have unveiled new knowledge but only when humans recognize their applicability.\n\nMoreover, the invention of computers has led to a reduction in the need for manual labor. This is evident on production lines, where robotics has replaced human operators to ensure efficient, non-stop, and consistent manufacturing. This has diminished the need for human skills and specialized occupations, as seen with lathe operators, where machines can produce identical goods without breaks. However, the employment of labor-saving devices can also liberate the human mind, allowing it to focus on more profound and creative pursuits. This advancement can ultimately benefit both society and the individual, as all brains are encouraged to learn and expand their capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, the computer has also contributed to making the brain redundant through its role in entertainment systems. The almost universal, and often excessive, devotion to video games and other forms of digital entertainment among the young and even adults has led to a decrease in the active use of the brain. While mastering video games can be a valuable skill, the widespread adoption of these activities has hindered the traditional learning process. The time and energy spent on such activities could be more productively applied to meaningful learning and development.\n\nIn conclusion, while computers have certainly transformed many aspects of our lives, they have not rendered the human brain redundant. Instead, they have shifted the nature of its application, emphasizing higher-order thinking and critical analysis over rote tasks. The challenge lies in harnessing these tools to augment human intelligence rather than diminish it, ensuring that the human mind remains a driving force for progress and advancement.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people from eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.\nPeople eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear for their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone and boil them up to produce offal. Hey presto, instant animal feed.

For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.\nIf people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead? The answer is pork, lamb and other meats. The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef. This would mean, that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are several reasons why people in the UK might cease to eat beef, such as a sudden shift towards vegetarianism or a change in taste preferences.

The only plausible reason for a significant reduction in beef consumption in the UK is the disease CJD, which is the human equivalent of \"Mad Cow Disease\" or BSE.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of cases of BSE, largely due to farming practices from 20 years ago. Specifically, during the 1960s and 1970s, cows were given feed containing sheep and their brains. This practice led to the development of BSE in many animals, which was then passed on to their offspring. Despite the lack of scientific evidence suggesting that BSE is directly transmitted to humans through beef consumption, the media has extensively documented cases of CJD and BSE. This coverage, including vivid images of diseased cows and humans, has significantly influenced public perception, creating a fear that could lead to a complete cessation of beef consumption in the UK.\n\nIf such a scenario were to occur, the agricultural industry would be severely impacted. Cow farmers would likely experience a dramatic decrease in numbers, as the beef market would be virtually destroyed. Consequently, the dairy products market, which is already limited, would not be able to sustain many farmers. Furthermore, if the BSE scare spreads to dairy products, it could lead to the complete extinction of the cow farming industry.\n\nHowever, if people in the UK were to cease eating beef, they would likely switch to other meats such as pork and lamb. This shift in demand would result in an increase in the production and consumption of these alternative meats, with the demand for beef being approximately proportionate to the increase in demand for other meats. This would likely benefit producers of these alternative meats, as they would face an increase in demand to meet the new dietary preferences.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal. In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat. The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time, this being a viral disease. It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers. The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating, e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on. However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef.\n\nAnother reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB.\n\nThese factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell. With global communications as good as they are now, it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it's safety.\n\nAlthough British farmers have learned to diversits, Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain.

While the rest of the beef is generally safe, the long incubation period of the disease and the press's disproportionate coverage have fueled public concern. Only a small number of people have actually died from BSE after a lifetime of consuming beef, but the fear persists.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the decline in beef consumption is the growing trend towards vegetarianism, albeit to a lesser extent than the BSE issue. Together, these factors could significantly impact the agricultural industry, potentially halting the sale of British dairy livestock both domestically and internationally.

After a few reported cases of CJD, a similar form of the disease found in humans, it is know thought that 'mad-cow disease' (BSE) is the cause. Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans.\nThis claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness. Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 %.\nAlthough scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef. customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some 'dodgy' butcher trying to cut costs. As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu. An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant.

In response, McDonald's immediately issued a notice assuring customers that their beef burgers are made from 100% pure, high-quality beef and contain no offal.\n\nIn my view, no reputable restaurant with a good reputation would risk using poor-quality beef, as any customer contracting CJD and tracing it back to a restaurant could result in substantial legal repercussions, potentially leading to lawsuits for thousands of pounds and the closure of the business.", "speed": 0.4629173394881021, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

Given the relative recency of BSE's introduction, too little is known at this stage.\n\nIf the market for beef were to drop significantly, it would have a drastic effect on the agricultural sector as a whole. A decrease in beef consumption would lead to an overproduction of cows, resulting in a surplus. These cows would need to be either slaughtered and wasted, or sold abroad, assuming foreigners remain unconcerned about BSE. Furthermore, if people stopped eating beef, they might also stop consuming products associated with it, such as milk and cheese, leading to a decrease in dairy product sales. This scenario would financially strain dairy farmers, possibly leading to bankruptcy and the need for subsidies. The government might be forced to import food, disrupting the state of autarky and costing the nation money. Farmers would have to dispose of their stock at a great expense and transition to farming other crops suited to their land and area. In addition, a beef substitute might need to be created.\n\nTo address these concerns, the government would have to carry out extensive checks on beef, particularly from 'mad cows.' The Ministry of Agriculture would be tasked with clarifying whether the meat is safe and proving it to the public to encourage continued consumption. The government would likely launch extensive advertisement campaigns to promote beef, but the recent reported death of a woman from mad cow disease makes this challenging.", "speed": 0.06582089752733487, "eta": "00h00m15s"}
