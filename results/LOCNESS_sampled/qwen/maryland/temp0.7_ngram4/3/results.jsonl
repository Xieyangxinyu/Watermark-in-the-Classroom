In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is a characteristic that often coexists with duplicity. As humans seek to understand the absurdity of their existence\u2014facing the inevitable defeat of their search for truth due to the world's incomprehensibility and their own mortality\u2014one outcome is the manifestation of guilt and the embrace of duplicity as a means to revolt against this absurdity.\n\nLa Chute illustrates this concept through various characters, each grappling with different forms of guilt. Clarence, the central character, embodies this struggle. Prior to his fall, his life in Paris was characterized by a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence.

The way in which he portrays Caligula shows the perversion of the attributes expressed in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" as desirable. although he in many ways epitomises the Absurd man, as Camus describes him, Caligula's way of dealing with the discovery of the futility of life is a warning of acting in an absolute way. Cherea is used by Camus as a counter-balance to Caligula's absolute nature, and although he is not illogical, he realises the value of life and is therefore suggested to be right.\nFollowing the death of Drusilla, Caligula has learnt the true nature of man's existence: <quote>. Man's mortality is now painfully clear to him, as is the futility of his life. And so Caligula has understood the absurdity of our condition; the fact that we can never possess the world and never have full clarity leaves him with a sense of anguish. However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it. Throughout the play, Caligula's reaction to the discovery of the Absurd is to try and carry out the impossible, thereby changing the nature of the universe, and making man mortal and therefore happy. This is symbolised by his quest for the moon, and he tells Helicon right at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory is quite logical, the impossible possession of the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and could therefore change man's condition. However, the reality is that Caligula can never make man mortal, and so unable to avoid death, he becomes death. This is a more concrete aspect of Caligula's logic; he cannot change his situation, and so instead resolves to inflict his anguish on everyone else. He does this by revealing death to them, by showing them the futility of life and their mortality. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In his play \"Caligula\", Camus explores questions he had previously raised in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" about the absurdity of life and our acceptance of it. The character of Caligula exemplifies the attributes expressed in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", yet his approach to the realization of life's futility is a warning against absolute actions. Caligula, though embodying the absurd man, fails to accept his situation, leading to a destructive path rather than finding happiness. Camus uses Cherea as a counterbalance to Caligula\u2019s absolute nature, highlighting Cherea\u2019s understanding of the value of life. Following the death of Drusilla, Caligula comes to understand the true nature of human existence: <quote>. He now painfully recognizes the inevitability of mortality and the futility of life. Thus, Caligula comprehends the absurdity of our condition, yet, unlike Sisyphus in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", he cannot accept it and finds no happiness in it.

This is symbolized by his pursuit of the moon, as he declares to Helicon at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory, while logical on the surface, is fundamentally flawed because Caligula cannot change his situation.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith. They seek refuge in religion, and according to Camus take a <quote>. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Le Mythe de Sisyphe is a novel deeply bound by the theme of duplicity, particularly in its central idea that life is both futile and worth living to the full. The primary themes explored in the novel are the absurdity of life and the concept of suicide.\n\nCamus begins by attempting to define the absurd, which he considers the foundational point of his work. He criticizes other philosophers for failing to fully recognize the potential of the absurd, often using it as a conclusion rather than a starting point. He states that absurdity emerges when an everyday object is stripped of its usual meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity, emphasizing the necessity of knowledge. However, he shares the Cartesian view that the only certainty is 'I think, therefore I am,' highlighting that knowledge about certain matters exceeds human comprehension. The disparity between the pursuit of fundamental truth and what can be definitively known remains unchangeable.\n\nThe process leading to the 'absurd' man involves several stages. Initially, an object's everyday meaning is suspended. Then, during a mundane task, the meaning of the action is abruptly withdrawn, making the futility of the act starkly apparent. Camus describes the realization of time passing and the resultant self-hatred for not making better use of life. When life is stripped of the meaning we typically assign to it, every action becomes futile. He also emphasizes the isolation and solitude that come with this realization, likening it to a light that does not shine.\n\nHaving grappled with the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people attempt to reject it by seeking refuge in religion. They take a 'leap of faith,' which Camus dismisses as a form of denial. These individuals essentially adopt a belief system that offers them a purpose beyond the inherent meaninglessness they have come to understand.", "speed": 0.449720301872709, "eta": "00h14m16s"}

Furthermore he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.\nOreste therefore starts off in a position of bad faith and moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticiy with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). This transformation is symbolised by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste her brother and not Phil\u00e8be. What primarily inflences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play.

All the characters have a negative or positive valouration and thus either help to evoke sympathy for Caligula. Caligula is the sole focus of attention in the play. It is his actions, thoughts and words which designate what will happen throughout the entire story.

In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on the Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands to the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.\nIn 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off.

It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him - <quote>. Shocked that it is not for his sister that he mourns but the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.\nHe announces that he wants \"la lune\" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but to other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too.

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children would then go on to Lyc\u00e9e and either to University or \"Les Grandes Ecoles\" so joining the class of the \u00e9lite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today. \nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a major concern for the later governments. Under the second and third republics not much advance was made on the education question as this did not appear to be a priority.\nUnder the forth republic reforms were proposed but because of the multi-party governments who had to face internal struggles all the time, they failed in most cases to be passed.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "To understand the current and recent situation of French education, it is crucial to examine its historical roots, particularly focusing on the role of Napoleon in shaping the educational system. In the late 18th century, Napoleon advocated for education as a means to ensure the smooth operation of the state. He did not prioritize individual rights to education but rather viewed it as a necessity for the state. At that time, with the majority of the population engaged in agriculture, a basic primary education was sufficient for the majority. Consequently, Napoleon left primary education mainly to the church, as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. In contrast, secondary and higher education were deemed more critical, as they trained professionals needed by the country. These sections of education were thus run by the state.\n\nThis system created a clear distinction between primary and secondary education, a gap that persisted until relatively recently despite various reform attempts. This structure did not facilitate social mobility: children from poorer backgrounds often left primary school, known as \"\u00e9cole primaire,\" with only a basic education. In contrast, children from wealthier backgrounds could continue to secondary and higher education, leading them to Lyc\u00e9e and ultimately to universities or \"Les Grandes Ecoles,\" thereby joining the elite class.\n\nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a significant concern for later governments. During the Second and Third Republics, education was not a priority, resulting in little advancement. Under the Fourth Republic, reform proposals were made but failed due to the multi-party governments' internal struggles and difficulties in passing legislation.", "speed": 0.449720301872709, "eta": "00h14m16s"}

On studying France throughout the twentieth century we can see that this is indeed true.\nIf we start at the beginning of the century we see that the growth of the population was inhibited greatly by the first world war, where France suffered many losses. The fact that the men in the society left to fight meant that the number of births was reduced greatly. This was also the case on the return of the men, when many did not come back having been killed. Therefore after the first world war the population of France decreased greatly.\nImmigration was already present at this time, and helped to make up for the large number of losses in the war. Slowly the population began to build itself up again until the beginning of the Second World War. In this war France did not suffer as many casualties and deaths as in the first world war, but the fact that there had already been losses made the situation grave for France.

After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff.

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conf\u00e9deration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism.

In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to reflect the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.\nWhen the socialists came to power in 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the \"code du travail\" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1/3 of this \"Code du Travail\" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, and before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.\nTrade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had to wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given a legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes. \nThe main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership of the PCF is  a large aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conf\u00e9deration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail-force ouvri\u00e8re) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become too radical for many of its Catholic members.

But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.\nMembership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions has always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, those members who were left tended to be those who identified with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.\nBefore 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's demands, and this did not help the falling membership numbers.\nEmployers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament. De Gaulle ended by strengthening the Executive in favour of the presidency and his interpretation of the most ambiguous word in the text, \"arbitrage\" has been untouched for more than 30 years.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Under the 5th Republic, the most salient feature to emerge is the form of presidentialism initiated by General de Gaulle and successfully maintained by his successors.

De Gaulle ultimately leaned towards strengthening the presidency, and his interpretation of the most ambiguous term in the text, \"arbitrage,\" has remained unchanged for more than 30 years.", "speed": 0.449720301872709, "eta": "00h14m16s"}

It was a compromise between the Gaullists and other political forces. Although a rather controversial constitution two facts did emerge. First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was practiced and preached by his predecessors. So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.\nThe role of the president is defined in the Constitution but is rather ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an \"arbiter\". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the making of policies or does it mean he must intervene and play an active role?\nThe term 'arbiter' is sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this they did. De Gaulle claimed it empowered him to rule the nations and his successors all acted as if it meant playing an interventionist role.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The constitution of the 5th Republic was adopted by the nation on September 28, 1958, as a compromise between the Gaullists and other political forces. Although widely regarded as controversial, this constitution reinforced the powers of both the presidency and the executive vis-\u00e0-vis the parliament. I will first discuss the roles of the Prime Minister and the President, then analyze how each presidency has evolved to reflect the shifting dynamics of governance.\n\nIn the constitution, the exact locus of authority is not clearly defined, a fact that has led to considerable debate. Some articles suggest that the Prime Minister is in charge, while past presidents and prime ministers have claimed the opposite. Some even argued for a twin-headed executive, but in practice, prime ministers have consistently acknowledged presidential supremacy.\n\nArticle 5 of the constitution states that the President is the \"arbiter\" of government. This term is inherently ambiguous and allows for multiple interpretations. It could mean that the President should play a neutral role, akin to an impartial referee, or it could imply an active, interventionist role. Giscard d'Estaing once defined the Prime Minister's role as being in charge of contingency problems, while the President handled permanent and essential issues. However, his response was more reflective of the prevailing practice rather than a strict interpretation of the constitution.\n\nThe role of the President is clearly defined in the constitution but remains a source of controversy. Article 5 claims that the President acts as an \"arbiter,\" a term that is vague enough to permit different interpretations. De Gaulle interpreted it as a mandate to rule the nation, a stance that his successors followed. In practice, each presidency has evolved, reflecting the interpretation and actions of individual leaders.\n\nOverall, the 5th Republic's constitution has established a governance structure that, while intended to balance powers, has led to significant ambiguity and varying interpretations over time.", "speed": 0.449720301872709, "eta": "00h14m16s"}

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the instability and limited power of coalition governments during the Fourth Republic, France needed a strong and stable government base. This became particularly urgent in 1958, when the Algerian uprising and unrest pushed the country to the brink. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 at Bayeux, but he had been sidelined by the French and the victorious allies, who did not appreciate his authoritarian approach. By 1958, De Gaulle was once again at the forefront, and the new constitution, which passed in a referendum with 85% 'yes' votes, marked a significant departure from the apathetic 53% vote in 1946. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, with the executive's powers not derived from the legislature. De Gaulle's actions swiftly demonstrated his dominance, clarifying the distribution of power.\n\nSeveral ambiguities surround the President's functions, particularly regarding Article 16, which grants him special powers in times of national emergency. However, no clear criteria define what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle invoked these powers, citing Algeria as the cause. However, this was hotly debated at the time, with many perceiving his use of these powers as an abuse of his authority.", "speed": 0.449720301872709, "eta": "00h14m16s"}

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat', a similar r\u00f4le to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It gave the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debr\u00e9, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reserv\u00e9\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian r\u00f4le of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.\nArticle 11 was not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle used it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to use Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition. It was also a good way to increase contact with the people outside of the normal methods.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Much of this ambiguity arose from the fact that the Constitution was a compromise between \"presidentialisme\" and \"parlementarism.\" The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State and was also designated as the \"chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat,\" a similar role to that of our Queen, and as Chief of the army.

It was particularly with Article 8 that a great deal of ambiguity arose. This article granted the President the power to name the Prime Minister but did not specify whether he also had the power to dismiss him. De Gaulle took advantage of this ambiguity and, after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958, was forced to withdraw him in 1962, as he no longer saw him as a useful Prime Minister, especially after the Algerian war.

At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixi\u00e8me year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization. He tried to prolong school life for a large number of pupils by making education compulsory until the age of 16, abolishing the entrance examination to the 'sixi\u00e8me' and abandoning the 'classe de la fin des \u00e9tudes', where children stayed at primary school until 14. He introduced the concept of orientation and observation, whereby a pupil could be directed towards the school mostly suited to his needs (the prestigious lyc\u00e9e and the College d'Enseignement G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), whilst trying to bring the two schools closer together. The lyc\u00e9e had always been the bastion of \u00e9litism, with its Napoleonic tradition.\nIn 1963 Fouchet created the College d'Enseignement Secondaire, a lower common secondary school, to try and encourage upward social mobility. Jean Capelle, a leading figure in the initiative had very much admired, and tried to emulate the English comprehensive schools. But in an article by Hain Gaziel, his efforts were a failure. The creation of 3 'fili\u00e8res' were basically a division between prospective lyc\u00e9e and C.E.G. students. The third stream was theoretically intended to push pupils to the upper two streams, but in practice transfer was difficult - only 1% managed it. It was dubbed the 'poubelle' of the system. These two reforms came at the time of a population expansion which demanded education of any kind and prevented proper reforms - giving away a little in order to conserve a great deal.\nSchool pupils became disillusioned, seeing the school as an agent of social discrimination. The lyc\u00e9es were for the bourgeois, cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, while the chances of the children of an 'ouvrier' getting anywhere near higher education were remote.

The education system needed immediate modernisation and democratization. The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual.

However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair.

In this conte Voltaire savagely condemns the doctrine of optimism; the notion that all is well in the world and that events occur as part of some Divine Purpose. Voltaire rejects this theory of optimism on the basis that there is so much evil in the world and this optimism is subject to great satire throughout 'Candide'. Voltaire presents optimism through the use of Pangloss who religiously adheres to this 'detestable principle' and he contrasts it with the pessimistic views of Martin and by showing many atrocities and evils in the world of which the conte provides an abundance. \n\tIn 1775 an earthquake struck Lisbon killing 40.000 people or more and this severely shook Voltaire's view and faith in God. Voltaire thus began to question the theory of optimism presented by Alexander Pope 1733-4 in his 'Essay on Man' that 'whatever is, is right': Voltaire asked: why do men suffer under a master who is just? Finding no answer, Voltaire rejected the principle of optimism- that logic and reason could somehow explain away the chaotic wretchedness of existence by ignoring the facts. Indeed the question of philosophical optimism is subject to much attack and satire in 'Candide'.\n\tVoltaire tackles it by juxtaposes this doctrine of optimism with the evils in society; rape, pillage, murder, massacre, hanging, storm, disease, earthquake, theft, prostitution contrast the theory that 'tout est bien dans le monde' which heightens its travesty.\n\tIn 'Candide' the character of Pangloss has the aim of representing this ridiculous 'philosophical optimism'. Pangloss believes that there can be 'no effect without cause' and he comes under great satire by Voltaire for adhering to this 'thoughtless optimism'. Pangloss taught 'metaphyisco-, theologo-, cosendo-, nigology'; 'nigology' is a made up word which shows that his teachings are a fraud and therefore Voltaire disreputes optimism.

The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to the earthquake itself.\n\tIn 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it. We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. Pangloss then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\tThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. This 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is clear to all but Pangloss showing no sympathy consoles Candide by saying that it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.\n\tVoltaire is in full flow now with incident after incident which stretch the reader's credulity to the limit but also go to show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point which is outlined above when the real earthquake occured.\n\tThe plot then goes into a ridiculous level. Candide is whipped and Pangloss is hanged at a magnificant auto-da-f\u00e9 which was held so that similar earthquakes would not strike Lisbon again.

It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he was alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it was only when man discovered the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus found the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.\n\tRousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads to the development of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.\n\tThis is the development of man into society from a stage of equality into a life of human inequality.\n\tRousseau looks at 'man-made-man' and sees how he is dehumanised when compared with earlier man.\n\tThe social development which occurred when men desired self-improvement led to man being capable of advancement due to science and scientific knowledge but as  Rousseau said, 'these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the *Discours sur l'origine de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9*, Rousseau depicts how the development of civilization has corrupted man's natural happiness and freedom by the creation of artificial inequalities of power, wealth, and social privilege. To uncover the origins of this corruption, Rousseau traces humanity's development from nascent man to the complex societies of the eighteenth century, identifying the principle sources of human equality.\n\nRousseau envisions natural man as physically strong, living in the woodland, uncomplicated, and having few needs: \"la nourriture, une femelle, et le repos.\" Central to Rousseau's argument is the image of natural man as innocent, independent, and inherently good. When man lived alone and relied on no one, he was equal to his fellow man. However, it was when man discovered the ability to cooperate and work together that the foundation of civilization was laid, leading to a corruption that eventually resulted in social inequalities.\n\nRousseau delineates man's development into five stages. The first stage is that of man's innocence, where he is wholly self-dependent and free from corruption. The second stage sees the formation of a social unit, the 'family,' as man builds a dwelling and becomes a protector and father. This is portrayed as the 'golden age' from which man was ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This desire led to the concept of property as man, now a cultivator, needed to protect the land he had cultivated from others, thereby leading to a state of perpetual war as described by Hobbes: \"of each against all.\" The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' to secure peace for everyone and escape this state of war.\n\nThis process illustrates the transformation of man into society, evolving from a state of equality into a life marked by human inequality. Rousseau also examines how man is dehumanized when compared to his earlier, simpler state. The social development that came with man's desire for self-improvement brought advancements through science and knowledge, but, as Rousseau noted, \"these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes.\"", "speed": 0.45929317676269665, "eta": "00h12m48s"}

Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurances, whether good or bad, is that 'all is for the best in the best of all worlds' it does not matter how much human misery and violence he is exposed to he still quotes his philosophy. \n\tVoltaire demonstrates the futility of this attitude in a very amusing, fast flowing way, Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\tVoltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences are good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westiphalia have been destroyed and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette, yet Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, there is no despair. Pangloss merely states that if it were not for syphilis there would be no chocolate in the world. Again through the complete absurdity of this comment Voltaire tackles the problem of thoughtless optimism.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Thoughtless optimism is a central theme in Voltaire's satirical novella \"Candide,\" and he personifies it through the absurd character of the philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's philosophy, that \"all is for the best in the best of all worlds,\" remains unchanged regardless of the amount of human misery and violence he encounters. Voltaire criticizes this attitude in a humorous and rapid manner, using Pangloss as a literary device to convey Candide's critique of thoughtless optimism. Rather than dismantling the philosophy bit by bit, Voltaire enhances its absurdity to such an extreme that it becomes incomprehensible.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Voltaire presents a series of significant human sufferings, both natural and man-made, which Pangloss interprets as part of a grand, benevolent design. The incongruity of Pangloss's philosophy in the face of such events becomes especially striking. For instance, when Jacques drowns, Pangloss halts Candide's rescue attempt by explaining that the earthquake and shipwreck were meant to occur so that Jacques would die in Lisbon harbor. Similarly, when Candide encounters Pangloss after his escape from the Bulgars, the old teacher is destitute and suffering from syphilis. Yet, Pangloss remains optimistic, asserting that syphilis is necessary for the world to have chocolate. Through these absurd examples, Voltaire skewers the notion of thoughtless optimism.", "speed": 0.45929317676269665, "eta": "00h12m48s"}

It is in the course of this journey that Voltaire shows us how abhorrent the climate of optimism was to him, an optimism which often was simply an excuse for the lethargy of contemporary society.\n\tThe story begins with Candide comfortably installed at the mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten Tronkh. Here, he is taught the philosophy of optimism by Pangloss, whose maxim is: \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible'.\n\tAt the mansion in Westphalia, Candide falls in love with the beautiful Cun\u00e9gonde, and because of this love he is thrown out of the house and forced to wander. He does not however forget what Pangloss has taught him, and na\u00efvely beleives in this philosophy almost to the end of the book. Candide experiences many things which would make anyone else turn away from the philosophy of optimism but he goes on vainly beleiving that  \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux'.\n\tFor example Candide is pressganged into joining the army and here he witnesses a bloody battle, where each side claims to be the victor having caused immense damage, and supposed heroes no worse than marauding rapists. Having survived this battle Cun\u00e9gonde moves on through to Holland, where he meets again his friend and teacher Pangloss, who is almost dead of the pox, which he caught from Paquette, who in turn had traced it back through a long line, including several churchmen. Pangloss himself, although in this sorry state, still maintains his optimism, and together they journey to Portugal. Here once again they suffer terribly, first of all their friend is killed by a vicious sailor, and they arrive in Lisbon to find it in the midst of a terrible earthquake which kills many thousands of people. Somehow Candide manages to conclude that this must be part of some divine plan, although he is possibly beginning to have some doubts.\n\tHis optimism is however renewed on his arrival in South America. The na\u00efve Candide remarks on how the sea and climate are much better here than in Europe and so decides that this must certainly be\n\t'le meilleur des mondes possibles'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the classic novella 'Candide,' Voltaire depicts Candide, the protagonist, on a journey of discovery filled with bizarre and often harrowing episodes. Through these experiences, Voltaire illustrates the profound abhorrence he felt towards the prevalent optimism of his time, which often served as an excuse for the inaction and complacency of society.\n\nThe story begins with Candide comfortably residing at the mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten-Tronkh, where he is tutored in the philosophy of optimism by Pangloss, who proclaims the maxim, \"Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible.\" At the mansion in Westphalia, Candide falls deeply in love with Cun\u00e9gonde, leading to his expulsion and subsequent wanderings. Despite the turmoil, Candide remains largely adherent to this philosophy, believing fervently in its promises almost until the end of the narrative.\n\nCandide experiences numerous events that would typically make one question the philosophy of optimism. For instance, he is forcibly conscripted into the army, where he witnesses a brutal battle that leaves both sides claiming victory, with supposed heroes behaving little better than marauding rapists. Following this, Cun\u00e9gonde travels to Holland, where she encounters her former tutor, Pangloss, who is near death from syphilis, which he contracted from Paquette. Despite his dire condition, Pangloss continues to espouse his optimistic views. Together, they journey to Portugal, where they suffer further misfortunes, including the tragic death of a friend and the witnessing of Lisbon's terrible earthquake that kills thousands.\n\nRemarkably, Candide manages to view these tragic events as part of a divine plan, though he may be beginning to harbor some doubts. His optimism is, however, briefly rekindled upon arriving in South America. Observing the sea and climate as superior to those in Europe, Candide concludes that this region must be \"le meilleur des mondes possibles.\"", "speed": 0.45929317676269665, "eta": "00h12m48s"}

He was not necessarily against Leibniz, Shaftesbury and Wolff even though he ridiculed their standardized terminology, but utterly opposed the perversions of this doctrine which offered the contrary. Such perversions turned this philosophy of hope into one of despair.\n\n\tVoltaire used pessimism as the main stream of attacking the philosophical doctrine of optimism. In this he includes suffering and misery which abound in the book.\n\n\tMartin is the character which Voltaire uses to represent pessimism, the view that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil and that everything that happens is for the worst. He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cun\u00e9gonde again. It is this hope which helps him to complete his life long journey.\n\n\tConversly, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory - 'all is best in the best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best'. He was Candide's tutor, who stood by this doctrine, in spite of all his sufferings - his own hanging, flogging and dissection. Such thinking angered Voltaire that good always comes out of evil particularly since the recent events of his day distrusted him so greatly - a disaster such as the earthquake at Linis and Lisbon in which thousands of people perished. How can that contribute to the common good?\n\n\tEvery character involved in the book has endured much suffering including Candide himself. In a sense, he was blinded by following the illusion of the love of his life, lady Cun\u00e9gonde, who he planned to marry one day. Voltaire presented her as an object of desire, the only reason why Candide continued on his journey but when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed. She had changed in beauty and personality, she had become unbearable to live with. The point Voltaire wished to make was that supreme happiness was unobtainable.\n\n\tHe also attacked the philosophy by showing that goodness/kindness is never recriprocated eg. Jacques, the Anabaptist, considered as a good man, saved a sailor from drowning during a tremendous storm as they approached Lisbon harbour. He himself however was swept overboard with the sailor do nothing to help. Even though Candide tried to save him, it was too late, he drowned.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Voltaire was hostile to the philosophical outlook of his day, which revolved around the doctrine of optimism.

This pessimism is embodied in the character of Martin, who views the world as inherently evil and believes that suffering and misery are ubiquitous. Martin pokes holes in Candide's naive hope for ultimate happiness, symbolized by the reunion with lady Cun\u00e9gonde, by highlighting how these hopes are constantly dashed. It is this persistent despair that drives Martin's narrative, as he challenges Candide to accept the worst.\n\nConversely, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\" Despite his own suffering, which includes a near-hanging, flogging, and dissection, Pangloss remains steadfast in his belief. This philosophy, which posits that good always emerges from evil, particularly angered Voltaire, especially in light of recent events such as the devastating earthquake in Lisbon, which killed thousands.

It is a doctrine of resignation ie one is supposed to sit back and accept everything that happens. This is illustrated by the character of 'Pangloss', who is whipped, hung, and nearly burnt alive at an 'auto-da-f\u00e9', yet still believes in the theory of optimism.\n\n\tAs Candide starts out with a na\u00efve and perhaps cheerful look on life, he soon discovers man's evil nature and the atrocities that man inflicts on himself.

He argued that we lived in the best of all possible worlds and explained the existence of evil by saying that in creating the world, God had to add a least amount of evil, for a world that was totaly perfect is divine and not suitable for humans.

His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cun\u00e9gonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721. He does this by showing the illogical traversity of it which Pangloss parrots throughout the story and jutaxposes it with a catalogue of diasters and human suffering eg/ rape, pillage war. Candide travels and search for Cun\u00e9gonde and by extension happiness is tested by every possible means. At first Candide determindly follows Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but towards the end begins to doubt it and finally rejects it after meeting the Negro slave in Surinam left lying naked at the side of the road, with an arm and a leg missing, by his master.

The passing of the Single European Act 1986 has given the concept of an open and common market a new lease of life by adding much detail to existing provisions in the EEC Treaty. Since the Single European Act 1986 the completion of such an open common market ( ie one free market for Europe with no trade barriers) can now be seen as a reality. However, even though Britain has joined the European Communities and accepted its affects through the passing of the European Communities Act 1972, there  has arguably been a very high price paid. This of course is the loss of absolute supremacy for the English Parliament.\n\t\tThe Orthodox theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy states that Parliament cannot restrict it's own legislative omnicompetence. That is, Parliament today cannot pass laws which limit tomorrow's Parliament's legislative powers, be they restrictions on manner and form, or as in the case of the European Communities Act, restrictions on subject matter. Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law. Therefore, in the case of a contradiction between the two, European Community law must be abided by. This first aspect of Britain's membership of the European Communities has thus already shown a restriction on Britain's legal system : that of the doctrine of implied repeal. The court's view of this argument is of utmost importance; however the judges have not had to decide this point as yet. The orthodox Lord Denning has described Britain's Accession as a \"farewell to our sovreignty\" on the one hand and yet on the other hand he has said that theoretically conferred powers can be retained, even though in practice it would be virtually impossible.\n\t\tThe radical theorists would agree that it is \"farewell to our sovreignty\" completely.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\".

Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union. As the title implies, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in Britain towards fuller integration with Europe is the belief that it will imply a loss of sovereignty for the elected government. In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.\n\t\tThe Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.\n\t\tBritain's reputation in Europe on these issues is not an enviable one.

The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard to define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public. A great fear of losing our sovereignty has stemmed from the varying theories of what \"1992\" entails, and from many people's wish to remain ignorant of current developments.\n\t\tThe most evident implication of the single market is, in my view, the abolition of trade and customs barriers. This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is ever introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to \"buy British\", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result. Similarly, British firms might look for new products in other countries if they are no longer constrained by tariffs, bringing more diversity to their product range and therefore enhanc?? profits.\n\t\tBut the question of the single currency is itself a subject of much controversy. I believe that it is an aspect which is more threatening to British sovereignty than the general concept of the single market. Somehow, the prospect of treating Europe as one market is more acceptable if the countries participating keep their individual currencies and hence their identities. However, the idea of all the states using one currency is generally regarded as being a much greater threat to sovereignty, and would mean, to many people, the sacrificing of their pound to suit the aims of the Europeans.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The single European market now seems to be inevitable, although many differing views and interpretations of the idea are still evident.

There are those who feel that Britain should join Europe and enter into \"The Single Market\". But, on the other hand there are those who believe that Britain's sovereignty is far too important to abandon it. We must now consider the pros and cons of Britain joining \"The Single Market\".\n\t\tIn general we are already closely linked with the rest of Europe. Some believe that all that seperates us is the Channel. Soon, of course, this will become even less of a barrier with the completion of the \"Channel Tunnel\". When this tunnel, which will run under the water between England and France, is finally completed ( hopefully in the near future) it will be much easier to travel to and from Europe. The European countries will become more accessible. This is merely one step towards \"The Single Market\". There are also plans concerning trade barriers.\n\t\tSome people intend to drop all the barriers where trade and commerce are concerned. In this respect, it would become much easier to obtain items from Paris or Rome and a lot quicker. Imports and exports will also become more frequent and popular. We will be able to sell our goods from Britain to a wider range of customers in several more countries, just as, in the same way, we will also have the ability to buy more goods from a wider background.

Perhaps it will also be possible to accumulate shares from German or Spanish business and they, vice versa.\n\t\tIn order to aid \"The Single Market\" there are proposals at present, to introduce one monetary system into Europe, including Britain.

It is crucial to consider the pros and cons of Britain's potential entry into \"The Single Market.\"\n\nIn general, Britain is already closely linked to the rest of Europe. Some argue that the only thing separating us is the Channel, and this barrier will soon diminish with the completion of the \"Channel Tunnel.\" Expected to be completed in the near future, the tunnel, running under the water between England and France, will facilitate easier travel and improve accessibility to European countries. This tunnel represents just one step toward \"The Single Market,\" which also includes plans to remove trade barriers.\n\nSome proponents wish to eliminate all trade and commerce barriers. This would make it easier to obtain goods from cities like Paris or Rome, and imports and exports would become more frequent and popular. British businesses could sell their goods to a wider range of customers in more countries, and consumers would have access to a broader variety of products. Buying and selling, along with business, would become increasingly important in \"The Single Market.\"\n\nIn order to facilitate \"The Single Market,\" there are current proposals to introduce a unified monetary system for Europe, including Britain. Advocates of this plan believe that it would make buying and selling, as well as travel, easier and smoother. The introduction of a single currency would essentially eliminate the complexities associated with foreign exchange and monetary comparisons on a global scale.\n\nHowever, there are also those who oppose the idea of a single monetary system, with Margaret Thatcher being a prominent example.

It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most; Political Union, followed by Economic and Monetary Union. In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead to many disputes within the present government. They also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher. In losing her, have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty\u00a0? Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back, \"not letting socialism in by the back door\", instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community. Great Britain cannot afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present, and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes. So, a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable, whether we like it or not. On monetary and economic Union, I don't feel that we have much to lose; in fact on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously, especially in the light of 1992. If only the issue were presented in a more positive light, perhaps with some modifications, I am sure that the British public would give their agreement. After all, how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international Stock Exchanges of New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt ? Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference\u00a0? Did not the \"Big Bang\" in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plummeting ? World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked; the effects of which often see no physical borders. I therefore see this European Unity as a natural process in World development, something which should be made easier rather than hindered. Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ? \n\t\tThe issue of Political Union is still more disputed. Yes, we have a Queen and what would happen to her - would she be forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?\nThis is a very typical misinformed and ignorant statement posed by certain British \"patriots\".<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic entity that comprises multiple forms, among which political and economic unions are most concerning for the British public. These issues have become highly contentious, leading to significant disputes within the British government and even contributing to the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher. The fear of losing sovereignty seems to have intensified, with the EU pushing for changes that the UK had been resistant to, such as not wanting to \"let socialism in by the back door.\" Instead of playing an active role in shaping these decisions, the UK has been in a reluctant position. In the current economic downturn, the UK cannot afford to be a passive player in a \u201ctwo-speed Europe,\u201d which has led to top governmental disputes. A loss of sovereignty seems inevitable, whether we like it or not.\n\nOn the issue of monetary and economic union, I do not see much to lose. In fact, I believe we would gain significantly, especially in light of the 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis. If the issue were presented in a more positive light, with necessary adjustments, the British public might be more willing to accept it. After all, how long has it been since we lost sovereignty to the volatility of international stock exchanges in New York, Tokyo, and Frankfurt? Will losing sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank truly make much difference? The \u201cBig Bang\u201d in October 1987 demonstrated the interconnectedness of global markets, with shock waves felt worldwide due to plummeting share prices. As world processes become increasingly interlinked, borders become less significant. Therefore, I see European unity as a natural process in world development and something that should be facilitated rather than hindered. Can we really afford to delay and drag our feet?\n\nThe issue of political union is even more disputed. Concerns about the fate of the Queen and the possibility of her abdicating in favor of King Jacques Delors are often raised, but these are typically based on misinformation and ignorance.

Sovereignty, originally invested in the Crown, today stems by convention from Parliament, which is traditionally believed to be legislatively supreme. As there is no written, or codified constitution in the U.K., which has a higher status than that of ordinary law, Parliament can theoretically make or unmake any law whatsoever. In the words of the known jurist Dicey : <\"     \">. All this shows that, by the orthodox, traditional approach, as it is considered impossible to bind subsequent governments as to the procedure or manner and form of legislation, it is impossible for entrenchment of statute to occur. Unification would by implication involve a universal european adoption of common laws, in order to provide compatibility between the individual constituent nation states, and in order for those laws to be recognized by the courts of this country, these laws would need to be adopted in the U.K. in the ordinary way, ie. by enactment of Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would see this as a \"loan\" of sovereignty rather than a \"loss\", for they would claim that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy the U.K. might seize back this sovereignty by repealing the european statutes, in the ordinary way.\n\tIt could be claimed that the U.K. made its first steps to unification when it joined the European Community (E.C.) by the enactment of the European Communities Act 1972. If one considers whether, by adopting this Act, the U.K. has lost some sovereignty, or  ????? \"loaned\" it, it will be possible to predict what effect subsequent legislation pertaining to the formation of \"a single Europe\" would have on the sovereignty of this country.\n\tSeveral reasons have been put forward as to why the European Communities Act 1972 cannot be normally repealed, and that the U.K. has lost sovereignty.

Ever since 1066, the last time that any foreign people successfully conquered British soil, the English (and later, the \"British\") have always been the conquerors. In the early Middle Ages, around the times of Edward I, II and III, the English Kings ruled large areas of France, and later in history during the reign of Queen Victoria the British Empire came into existence. With the granting then of independance to the colonies Britain was restricting her sovereignty, for which special Acts had to be passed to enable her to do this, but Britain has always retained absolute sovereignty over our own destiny. We have always been our own people, never accepting any higher power (NB we broke away from the power of the Catholic church, and the authority of Rome in Tudor times).

The diversity of the cultures, languages and political structures present in these nations mean that unification will lead to complex problems on national and international levels. One of the most contentious issues is the pace at which reforms should be initiated and carried out. There is a conflict between federalist nations like Germany and those who wish for a more loosely structured Europe and slower reforms, which seems to be the view of our present government in Britain.\n\tThe fears of European federalism which are expressed by many of our leading politicians and legal figures stem from the idea that the sovereignty of our Parliament is paramount. This view of the legislative supremacy was expressed by Dicey who wrote that \"...quote...\". Problems arose with Britains accession to the European Communities in 1972. By this Act Britain was argued to have limited its legislative competence in certain fields were it had handed its sovereignty to Community Institutions. However the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy meant that the British Courts were under a duty to apply the legislation made by the British Parliament. This has led to two interpretations of Community Law with the European Court of Justice consistently ruling that Community legislation must be applied uniformly throughout the member states.\n\tHowever the argument goes beyond these doctrinal questions. Many people are worried about the lack of democratic control over the Community decision making process and the voting systems used to enact legislation. Another problem is the intention of the Community organs to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of its Member States with a view to promoting the development of Europe as a whole, and in particular reducing the disparities between  the various States and in particular those with the weakest economies, for example Italy. This means legislation must be adopted to further these aims and this means that by joining the Community Britain has undertaken to implement necessary legislation within its sphere of influence. This obviously means that Britain has limited its legislative sovereignty in some areas.

There is a notable conflict between federalist nations, such as Germany, and those advocating for a more loosely structured Europe with slower reforms\u2014this latter view appears to be the stance of our current British government.\n\nThe fears of European federalism expressed by many leading British politicians and legal figures primarily stem from the belief in the paramount sovereignty of the British Parliament. This view of legislative supremacy was articulated by Dicey, who stated, \"...quote...\". When Britain acceded to the European Communities in 1972, it effectively limited its legislative competence in certain fields by handing its sovereignty to Community Institutions. However, the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy meant that the British Courts were bound to apply the legislation made by the British Parliament. This has led to two interpretations of Community Law, with the European Court of Justice consistently ruling that Community legislation must be applied uniformly throughout member states.\n\nBeyond these doctrinal questions, many are concerned about the lack of democratic control over the Community decision-making process and the voting systems used to enact legislation. Another significant issue is the intention of the Community organs to strengthen economic and social cohesion among its Member States, with a view to promoting the development of Europe as a whole, particularly in reducing disparities between the various states, especially those with weaker economies, such as Italy. This necessitates the adoption of legislation to further these aims, meaning that by joining the Community, Britain has undertaken to implement necessary legislation within its sphere of influence. Consequently, this limits Britain\u2019s legislative sovereignty in some areas.\n\nThe impact of the Single Market on the British economy is another crucial concern. As part of the European Community, Britain must align with Community rules and regulations, which may affect its economic policies and practices. Thus, while Britain has gained from participation in a united Europe, such participation also entails a degree of legislative sovereignty.", "speed": 0.48421799965819157, "eta": "00h11m02s"}

Any powers granted to a European government will surely have to be offset by a loss to national government.\n\tThe European Monetary System for example provides a more rigid structure for Europe than individual governments will have been used to.

It cannot for example devalue its currency beyond a certain narrow band, as it may have done before when attempting to improve domestic industries competitiveness, faced with international competition.\n\tThe loss of customs barriers within Europe in 1992 will, in the eyes of many people, threaten Britain's sovereignty. Internal barriers will be removed in favour of a common barrier to protect Europe as a whole.

This form of unification will affect Britain especially, since Britain's position in Europe has always been made slightly different by the fact that it is an island.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice. The           for the European Community will be the year 1992 when the internal market will be completed and trade barriers lifted and there will be common policies on social level.\n\tThis closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the devastations of World War II, closer cooperation among European States has existed on all levels.

Britain has been recognised as having a particular skill in the areas of banking and insurance. European market will give us the opportunity to use this skill in a far wider market. The creation of one European commercial market will also benefit the consumer since a homogenisation of standards is also in the process of being introduced, hopefully to the highest common denominator.\n\tThe European does not serve only as a useful trade association, however, for environmental problems can be tackled more effectively if the European community confronts such problems together. Co-operation between the communities police forces will assist in overcoming the problems of drug-smuggling and terrorism. The common defence policy of such a large area of Europe would also be beneficial and possibly less costly if the member states pooled their resources.\n\t However some loss of national sovereignty will inevitably occur. The single European Act was designed to speed-up the decision making of certain institutions. The act meant that member governments had to be committed to greatest co-operation and joint action in the areas of foreign, social and environmental policy thus leaving less room for differences of opinion among the members.

These countries have since been moving closer together on more institutional lines. One such demonstration of this has been the forming of the European Community, made up from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Economic Community.\n\tIn 1987, the European Community adopted the single European Act in which the member countries committed themselves to the realisation of a single internal european market by 1992.

This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\tBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision-making ability. The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created.

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.  As the EEC assumes ever greater proportions the debate, particularly in Britain, is centred around a potential loss of sovereignty as the member states look to integrate further.\n\tParliament is no longer the sole source of English law.  As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - that is without the interference of Parliament.  The Single European Act has given rise to more majority voting in the European instititions which means it becomes increasingly possible to introduce legislation in the U.K. to which no one here has agreed.

Lastly, they claim that prayer can help decrease the rise in violent crime, divorce, and teenage pregnancies.\n\nWhile the article \"A Religious Argument Against School Prayer\" offers stronger support for the Civil Liberties Group's stance, it still presents weak solutions. In contrast, the article \"Prayer in Public Schools, It's Nothing New to Many\" by Peter Applebome and \"Despite Debate in Many U.S. Schools, Prayer Has Become a Part of the Day\" by David Klinghoffer both adopt a biased attitude towards the values and consequences of prayer in schools. However, the article \"Jefferson Still Lives\" provides the best solution by suggesting a period of silence before class, allowing students to reflect without imposing any specific religious beliefs.\n\nThe Conservative Religious Group and the two articles, \"Prayer in Public Schools, It's Nothing New to Many\" by Peter Applebome and \"Despite Debate in Many U.S. Schools, Prayer Has Become a Part of the Day\" by David Klinghoffer, present a biased and poorly reasoned argument against the idea of prayer in public schools. One of their main arguments is that religion plays a significant role in some educational courses. As Klinghoffer states, \"religion permeates the curriculum in many schools.\" While this statement provides a valid reason for maintaining religious elements in schools, it fails to address how to reintegrate these elements effectively into the curriculum.", "speed": 0.4667182525060677, "eta": "00h10m19s"}

These dilemmas can range from a\nsimple act of choosing which friends side to take in a disagreement, or\nsomething more serious, like a priest giving up his reconciliation oath\nand handing over a confidential confession of a murderer to the police.\nWe make most of these decisions based on our values and beliefs. One's\nvalues and beliefs tend to stem from their religious background or the\nmorals and ethics on which they were raised. It is these ethics that\ncontribute to the majority of our decision making tactics. When forming\na decision, based on ethics, we must be careful to determine which side\nis morally correct.\nA dilemma in which morals have come up more often than not is the case\nfor animal rights. Should these animals be tested for the protection of\nhuman lives, or more importantly, what gives us the right to test these\nanimals? Now, in the Bible, it says that humans were to have <*>. What\nbetter of an authority figure than God, could give us this right.\nAnimals were put on earth for humans to do with as they please, as long\nas we did not take advantage of this gift. I believe animal testing in\nmost cases is trying to save people's lives, one way or the other. The\ndecision must be made that a human's life is more important than an\nanimal's life. Animal testing is a crucial part of our society and must\ngo on, if human's want to continue as the superior species. An example\nof this, is a three year old, named Timmy Baker has a heart attack from\na disease he possibly contracted from eating an undercooked hamburger.\nHe is not responding to resuscitation efforts and his doctor, Dr Michael\nMcManus, decides to give him the epinephrine drug. The dosage\nrecommended by the medical association does not work, but Dr McManus has\nheard of the research done by Dr Traystman. In research done by\nTraystman, pigs are electronically subjected to heart attacks,\nresuscitated, and then given a dose of the drug epinephrine. This drug\nis used to help revive heart attack victims while simultaneously\npreventing brain damage from occurring. He also conducts tests\ndetermining whether additional doses of the medication can help a\nsuffering patient.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Humans face many dilemmas every day, some easily justified and some not.

Should animals be subjected to tests to protect human lives, or is there an inherent right not to be tested? The Bible states that humans were given dominion over animals, suggesting that God, as the ultimate authority, granted us this right. Animals were placed on Earth for us to use, provided we do not abuse them. I believe that in most cases, animal testing is justified as a means to save human lives. The decision should be made that the value of a human life outweighs that of an animal\u2019s life.\n\nA practical example is the case of a three-year-old named Timmy Baker, who had a heart attack due to a disease possibly contracted from an undercooked hamburger.

It's true that it\ncan be transmitted in a variety of ways, but none of these involve\ncasual contact. In fact, nearly all instances in which AIDS can be\ntransmitted involved a rather intimate relationship, whether that be\nbetween two sexual partners, or a mother and child. The instances of\npeople acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions has been so greatly\nreduced, that it has nearly been eliminated. Despite the very specific\ninstances in which a person can contract AIDS, many people are being\ndiscriminated against in the job market, in trying to receive health\ncare, and in applying for, or maintaining insurance coverage because\nthey have AIDS. We as a society need to start viewing these people as\nvictims of a deadly, and fatal disease, rather than as criminals, or\noutcasts of society. It is morally and legally wrong for people with\nHIV, or AIDS to be discriminated against by employers and insurance\ncompanies simply on the basis that they are afflicted with the disease.\nOne can conclude from the evidence that will be shown here that this\nkind of discrimination is happening, and that it is in fact wrong, both\nlegally and morally. The opposition offers a weak argument that the\nrights of employers and insurance companies should be paramount to the\nrights of people who are afflicted with AIDS, when it comes to deciding\nwho and who not to hire, or who and who not to insure.

It is true that it can be transmitted in a variety of ways, but none of these involve casual contact. In fact, nearly all instances in which AIDS can be transmitted involve a rather intimate relationship, whether that be between two sexual partners or a mother and child. The instances of people acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions have been greatly reduced, nearly eliminating this specific mode of transmission. Despite the very specific instances in which a person can contract AIDS, many are being discriminated against in the job market, in trying to receive health care, and in applying for or maintaining insurance coverage because they have the disease. We as a society need to start viewing these people as victims of a deadly and fatal disease, rather than as criminals or outcasts. It is morally and legally wrong for people with HIV or AIDS to be discriminated against by employers and insurance companies simply on the basis that they are afflicted with the disease.\n\nOne can conclude from the evidence that will be shown here that this kind of discrimination is happening, and that it is indeed wrong, both legally and morally. The opposition argues that the rights of employers and insurance companies should be paramount to the rights of people with AIDS when deciding who to hire or insure, but this argument is weak and fails to align with moral and legal standards.\n\nAIDS, as a disease, is actually relatively young and therefore not fully understood. We know how people can contract the disease and the inevitable effects it has on those who are infected.

Those who do\nfeel that way see pictures of Oliver Twist or Little Orphan Annie in a\ndreary prison for children. While over the past century, there have been\npoorly run orphanages, the vast majority were a pleasant place for\norphans to grow up.

There are still a few orphanages running today,\nhowever the number is no where near it was one hundred years ago. With\nthe current welfare crisis, many such as Republican Newt Gingrich feel\nthat support payments should be stopped or greatly reduced to mothers\ncontinuing to have children on welfare. The money would then be used to\nsupport orphanages. This of course would mean taking many children away\nfrom their natural parents. Opposition to the whole idea of orphanages\nrefute it mainly because of two reasons. They disagree with the break\u001eup\nof families and feel the whole policy would be too costly. While these\ntwo ideas are difficult to content with, the truth is in the numbers.\nMany children not only live in homes that cannot support them\nfinancially, but are abusive. These children are not receiving warm and\nnurturing care, but may be scarred for life. There are also too many\npeople taking advantage of the system by continuing to have children to\ngain financial support.

These children are not receiving the warm and nurturing care they need and may be scarred for life. Additionally, there are too many people exploiting the system by continuing to have children to secure financial support.

This is entirely\nethical and in most cases necessary to continue to have many of the\nprograms and facilities that the universities offer. To accomplish this,\nmany universities add courses and provide new things such as research\nlabs and new cutting edge equipment. Many universities even try to\naccommodate the changing needs of the students by providing services\nsuch as free tutors and bigger staffs.\nBut not once before have I heard of a university trying to attract\nstudents with grass, trees, and a fountain. To be exact, about five city\nblocks of it, none the least. That's right, our very own Marquette\nUniversity is trying what in my opinion is one of the most unethical\nideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to attend to\ndifferent racial histories and so\u001ecalled physcological differences. This\ngreen space is supposed to create a more comfortable learning\nenvironment, but might just reverse this comfort when students see the\ncost of just under five blocks of grass. It's a whopping ten million\ndollars that the students, not the gesus, are going to pay. Even if they\ndivvy it up over twenty or so years, many students can't afford this\nincrease. I myself am barely scraping by. Plus this grass will cost\nlocals a matching ten million dollars just to reroute all of the\nutilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue.\nSome of the utilities effected by the common's project will be local\nbuses. If many of you noticed, about three to five routes come through\nMarquette's planned commons and that just might cause problems. The\ntransit company is estimating to lose between \"$1 million and $600,000,\"\nwhich the university is trying to offset by getting students on the U\u001e\npass system. The University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this\nsystem. I feel that this won't help, considering that a large number of\nstudents that already use the county transit and contribute to the\nprofits of the county's transit. I feel that the city might lose more mo\nney, rather than less, as Marquette thought through the U\u001epass system.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In all of the colleges and universities across the United States, administrators are striving to increase enrollment. This is both ethical and often necessary to sustain various programs and facilities. To achieve this, many universities introduce new courses and add amenities like research labs and cutting-edge equipment. They also seek to meet the evolving needs of students by providing services such as free tutoring and larger staffs.\nInterestingly, however, one university has taken a unique approach to attract students: a vast expanse of green space, covering about five city blocks, complete with grass, trees, and a fountain. Marquette University, in particular, is embarking on this project, which, in my opinion, is one of the most unethical ideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to address different racial histories and so-called psychological differences.\nThis green space is meant to create a more comfortable learning environment. Yet, when students see the cost\u2014nearly five blocks of grass at a staggering ten million dollars\u2014they might find themselves less comfortable. This cost is not being absorbed by the university itself; instead, students will bear the burden, with only an estimated ten million dollars to be spread over twenty years or more. Even with this amortization, many students can hardly afford the increase. My own financial situation is already precarious.\nMoreover, the project will require a matching ten million dollars for utility rerouting, specifically Wisconsin Avenue. This will impact various utilities, including local bus routes. About three to five bus routes currently run through Marquette\u2019s planned commons, potentially causing disruptions. The transit company estimates a loss between $1 million and $600,000, but the university plans to offset this by encouraging students to use the U-pass system. While the University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this system, I believe it won't help as many students already use the county transit system and contribute to its profits. In fact, I fear the city might end up losing more money due to the U-pass system.", "speed": 0.4667182525060677, "eta": "00h10m19s"}

Proponents of euthanasia argue that\nthe Declaration of Independence states life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness as rights that all American possess. Opponents of euthanasia\npresent the questions, \"does the right to your own life include the\nright to take that life as well?\" In my opinion, that should not be so.\nSimply because that there are few people who are thinking of taking\nthere own lives and are also of sane mind. If someone is having a bad\nenough struggle within themselves that they are willing to end that God\u001e\ngiven life, then it is possible that the individual is not mentally or\nemotionally stable to make that decision. So, who is to decide whether a\nlife is worth living? Who can project whether a patient in a coma will\ncome to consciousness or not? With questions such as these, there is no\nblack or white answers. There is a large gray area involved in answering\nthose questions that the law is supposed to cover. Within this paper it\nwill be shown that there are three ideas working against the practice of\neuthanasia. For one, America is not ready to allow any human being to\ntake an innocent, and in some cases a guilty individual from this world,\nwhether it be his/her own or another. The second idea is that it is too\ndifficult to determine if a person will suffer too much in his or her\nlifetime to go on living. This idea is held together by the fact that\nthere is too much gray areas within ethics and that patients or doctors\ncan not decisively determine whether a live is worth living. The third\nidea is that the \"law\" that determines whether a life is \"worth living\"\nis too vague and allows for too many shaky judgments to be made. Because\nof these reasons, euthanasia should not be allowed to be practiced as\nfreely as it is in the United States.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Euthanasia is practiced throughout the U.S., yet it remains a highly controversial topic. Proponents argue that the Declaration of Independence guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights. Opponents question whether the right to life also includes the right to end it. In my opinion, this decision should not be left to an individual. After all, those considering ending their lives might be struggling so intensely that their mental or emotional stability is compromised. Who should decide whether a life is worth living? Who can accurately predict whether a patient in a coma will regain consciousness? These complex questions lack clear, definitive answers, making the law's role in this matter challenging.\n\nThere are three primary reasons why euthanasia should not be practiced as freely as it is in the U.S. First, America is not yet prepared to allow any individual to take another person, whether innocent or guilty, out of this world, whether it be by their own hand or by the hand of a medical professional. Second, it is too difficult to determine if a person will suffer so much that life is no longer worth living. This difficulty is compounded by the ethical gray areas involved and the inability of patients or doctors to conclusively determine the worth of a life. Lastly, the law that supposedly determines the worth of a life is too vague, allowing for too many uncertain judgments. Due to these factors, euthanasia should not be practiced as extensively as it is in the U.S.", "speed": 0.4667182525060677, "eta": "00h10m19s"}

Proponents of abstinence-only education argue that following their approach would result in a decrease in rates of sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS, and teenage pregnancies. However, proponents have often used illogical reasoning or fallacies to support their ideas. On the other hand, supporters of comprehensive sex education believe that providing inaccurate information might lead teenagers to disregard abstinence-only advocates and continue engaging in sexual activities without proper precautions. Consequently, these advocates are leveraging the misinformation of their opponents to gain support for their own cause.\n\nMany of the suggestions made by supporters of abstinence-only education can be easily refuted with common sense. For example, Pat Socia, an activist and speaker for abstinence-only programs, once asked, \"How can teenagers be expected to abstain from sex if they don\u2019t know what it is?\" This question is misleading since better prevention methods ten years ago included birth control pills and hormone injections, which do not prevent the transfer of bodily fluids as effectively as condoms do. Furthermore, a spokesperson for Teen-Aid, Inc., another abstinence-only program, stated, \"Abstinence is the only sure way to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.\" Opponents of abstinence-only education counter that most teens are aware that these claims are not true.

Suicide means the end of all problems (Though those problems\nare usually solved easily.) This topic has many sides but can be\nanalyzed with two: those who advocate rational suicide and those who\noppose it. To analyze specific values and consequences, I will only\ndiscuss the opponents of suicide. There are a vast number of reasons\nagainst attempting suicide. In one way or another, people seem to\njustify them all. People often discuss how selfish a suicide can be.\nOthers discuss the grief\u001estricken family. They feel no pity for the\nperson who committed suicide either. Yet, others speak of the\ninvolvement of religion in the lives of those that attempt and commit\nsuicide. The opponents of suicide often neglect to prove their\nstatements. All the statements that people make are good statements\nthat, with some thought, can be rationalized. The opponents simply fail\nto provide the evidence for the rationalization of their arguments.\nThe authors of the first argument fail to prove it. The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish. He does not feel that there is any\nsuicide that can be considered rational because all suicide fails to\nthink about the effects of a suicide on others. He states that <*>. Mr\nRauscher hopes to convey that the only thing that people who commit\nsuicide do is think about whether they should end their own pains. Yet,\nRauscher fails to analyze his opposition. He should ask what does the\nperson attempting suicide thinking? The person may be thinking about his\nfamily and friends when he or she attempts suicide. For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous.\nMaybe Mr Rauscher does not think about what the sight of that pain and\nthe family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their\nemotions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Many events in our lives have consequences, but none are as drastic as suicide. Suicide means the end of all problems, though those problems are usually solved easily. This topic can be analyzed from various angles, but for the purpose of this essay, we will focus on those who oppose it. There are numerous reasons against suicide, and while people often justify them, the opponents of suicide fail to provide substantial evidence for their arguments.\n\nOne of the primary arguments against suicide is that it is selfish. People frequently discuss how a suicide can be seen as a selfish act, neglecting to show empathy toward the person who has committed it. Others argue that a suicide leaves the family grief-stricken and that there is no pity for the person who took their own life. Yet another perspective comes from religious beliefs, which often involve strict ethical prohibitions on suicide and its perceived effects on the soul.\n\nDespite the strength of these arguments, opponents of suicide often neglect to provide evidence to support their claims. The authors of the first argument fail to prove that a suicide is always selfish, a claim that is weak without substantial evidence. William Rauscher, in his work \"The Case Against Suicide,\" argues that all suicide is a selfish act because it disregards the effects on others. However, Rauscher fails to consider the thoughts of the person attempting suicide. He assumes that the person is only thinking about ending their own pain, but this may not be the case. The person may be considering the impact of their actions on family and friends.\n\nFor example, someone dying of lung cancer might cause more emotional pain for their loved ones if they were alive, given the enormity of the pain they experience. This scenario might lead them to consider the suffering of their family and friends and the helplessness they would experience in comforting the person. Rauscher's argument assumes that the person attempting suicide is not thinking about the broader impact on those around them. By failing to consider these broader implications, Rauscher's argument becomes less compelling.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments against suicide, the opponents often fail to provide adequate evidence. The act of suicide is a complex issue that requires a thorough examination of multiple perspectives, including the thoughts and feelings of the person attempting it.", "speed": 0.4667182525060677, "eta": "00h10m19s"}

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers. If we recognize that a work force filled with such diversity of workers will inevitably include women - of all ages - as well as man with family responsibilities, then we see the undeniable economic connection between this \"low value\" contribution of child care providers, and the economic strength of the nation. It is not difficult to conclude that child care workers are underpaid, and the issue will be difficult to resolve without  involving employers or the government in the child care industry - which may not be the ideal solution. It is tempting to conclude with the proposal that we, as a society, consciously work to raise the status of workers who care for children - but the final irony is that, until the financial status of these workers becomes more equal, they will not be judged as making a valuable \"contribution to the society they live in.\"\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The idea that seemingly aligns with American society's perceived values of equality appears initially harmonious.

Whether they be male or female has no bearing on the size of their reward; \"equal pay for equal work\" is a well-worded and time-honored phrase.\n\nBut what is \"equal work\"? It is fairly easy to establish equity between marketplace jobs with duties and responsibilities that are roughly similar. For example, a teacher of sophomore high school English and a teacher of senior high school English perform comparable tasks and should therefore be equally compensated. However, how do we compare raising a family of four children over a period of twenty-five years to the job of a neurosurgeon over the same period of time? I know of no culture on this globe that pays a woman (or a man, for that matter) a yearly salary of $50,000 for nurturing and educating children from the cradle to near-dependence. And yet, this contribution to society is immense and practically immeasurable. In fact, many of the ills of society in the U.S. today have been traced by study after study to the lack of firm guidance and support from the family.", "speed": 0.4600930720074712, "eta": "00h09m18s"}

Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up of majority of each person's day. In order to feed your family you had to plant. In order to live you had to build. To have clothing, you had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times the harder you worked, the more food, shelter or clothing you gained. This is a very simple support of reward equaling effort.\nBringing this to a more present time, we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology, expanding knowledge, and modern times.

However, that is not always true in the real world. There are many persons who engage in criminal activity to their advantage. In fact one needs only to consider the historical context, the current material gain, and even the consequences of crime in America to prove that crime can be a profitable profession.\nThroughout history crime is a recurrent theme, often praised as the years pass and events become more distant. Consider the vents shaping America's early history: the people involved in the Boston Tea Party were certainly breaking the law when they dumped private property into the harbor, yet this crime became a rallying cry for the American Revolution. Even Benedict Arnold's actions were considered criminal only because of the date on which they occurred.

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims. I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true, but now many employers are the victims. They are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I agree that in the past, women faced significant societal roles that limited their opportunities in the workplace and at home. Women were often looked down upon if they tried to advance, and pay discrepancies were common when men and women performed the same job. However, the age where women were required to stay home is over; now, many women work, while those who choose to stay at home do so by their own choice. Much of the change in women's roles can be attributed to feminist movements, which have defended women's rights over the years and shown the modern world what women can achieve in the workplace.\n\nWhile feminists have played a crucial role in advocating for women\u2019s rights, their approach is not always inclusive of all women. Some women were content with traditional roles, while others desired more in their lives. The issue arises when all women are expected to conform to the demands of these feminist movements, which can be difficult for those who don't align with their goals. An example is military women who wish to serve in combat positions during war. During the Iraq War, feminists argued for women's inclusion, believing they should have the chance to fight. I found these arguments misguided; women are not physically equipped to fight in wars and could be vulnerable to rape if captured. On the other hand, many other women are content with the existing rules.\n\nFeminist movements have also emphasized issues such as unfair workplace promotions and sexual harassment. Many women feel that they are victims in these situations, but I believe that the situation has evolved. In recent years, many employers have been the victims of false accusations, and women can sometimes be viewed differently in the workplace. While women have historically faced challenges, the landscape has become more complex and nuanced.", "speed": 0.4600930720074712, "eta": "00h09m18s"}

Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter. With this attitude someone could definitely headed for destruction. Its's like when you are a small child trying to see just how much your parents will let you get away with before they discipline you. For an individual that starts out doing small crimes (or less serious crimes that do not harm or endanger the life of another indivudual or a group of people) each time that they are not caught, that just makes them want to try just one more thing that they feel that they may just slide with, and the cycle goes on and on. Once you reach this stage you can consider yourself a habitual offender or someone that needs some kind of jail sentence, punishment or some type of deterent to stop you if not slow you down.\nBesides the fact that you will eventually get caught doing a crime your punishment varies according to the type of crime or crimes that the individual has committed. For example you can expect to get a stiffer punishment for a crime whrn you have endangered someone's life or their personal safety in some way. For those of us who have consciences (especially me having a \"weakness\" for children) would never ever dream of committing crime that may endanger another individual's well-being.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I firmly believe in the old saying that crime does not pay. This belief stems from the understanding that any action, no matter how hidden in the darkness, will eventually come to light. For instance, if I robbed a bank and managed to steal a cool million, I might feel financially secure and satisfied initially. However, if I were to get away with it, the temptation to commit more complex or dangerous crimes might increase. This mindset can lead to a destructive cycle. It's akin to a small child testing boundaries to see how far they can go before being disciplined.\n\nSimilarly, individuals who start with minor crimes often find that each time they avoid detection, it empowers them to try even more serious offenses. The cycle continues, and over time, they might become habitual offenders or require serious punishment to deter them. Once someone reaches this point, they are likely to face significant legal consequences, including jail sentences or other severe penalties.\n\nMoreover, the punishment for crimes varies depending on the nature and severity of the offense. For instance, endangering someone's life or personal safety often results in stiffer penalties. As someone who has a conscience, especially regarding the well-being of children, I can confidently say that I would never consider committing a crime that could harm another person.\n\nIn conclusion, not only does committing a crime come with significant risks of being caught, but the potential punishments are also severe and can escalate based on the severity of the offense.", "speed": 0.4600930720074712, "eta": "00h09m18s"}

The key is in the definition of term money; money, or whatever a group uses as a means of barter to obtain resources, represents power. Enough money gives you the power to get whatever you need to survive, lack of money may mean you can't survive. But the \"power\" money holds encompasses more than the ability to simply provide sustenance for life.

But there is another side to possessing money.\n\nMoney of itself is neither good nor bad. Ones's attitude about money is the deciding factor that determines what influence money has. It can be an influence for evil if the need for whatever it buys is possessing the buyer--whether that is a physical or an emotional need. The list of addictions people develop are endless; drug use, gambling and prostitution are obvious problems, but there are others more subtle. The need for material possessions can be an addictive force behind one's need for money.

I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touch their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the \"I'd rather do it myself\" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, whether you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitude of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.\nNow, after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to be in the 60's, and not looking down on females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home. \nNowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and take care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent with each other).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I have been living on this continent for 40-plus years, and while I support some of the causes women are advocating for, I disagree with much of it.

I can say that I am truly educated on \"both sides of the track\". \nI have opinions on both aspects of crime. I will begin with the unorganized first and save the best for last. To me, an unorganized criminal must be very good and have considered all aspects of what they are doing in order not to get caught. The types of crimes these individuals commit are things like: robbery, assault, rape, and theft. More or less, these are petty offenses because they do not hold a high dollar value. These people are usually somewhat less educated and believe what they do is essential for survival. I cannot comment on whether there is a valid reason for committing a crime or not, but I do know that life for some people is very difficult and unless someone can really feel and understand what others go through, they have no room to judge. This type of crime very rarely pays, because the criminals just are not that good. People tell others what they did and soon the word is out. There are - in many cases - witnesses to the acts.

What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history of the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity. Nowadays, both \"feminist\" and \"feminism\" are dirty words because the cause has been misused by people who want women to be dominant rather than equal.\nSusan B. Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment in society. The ideas behind \"feminism\" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights to the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life. Rather, the more people that feel comfortable that they have a say in how their life turns out, or is lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.\nThe concept many people today have of a \"feminist\" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. But, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout at the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism then they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the dominant gender and all men should adhere to their wishes and call it feminism then they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for the radical women to get angry under, to shout from and to feel safe within.

Instead, the more people feel comfortable that they have a say in how their lives turn out, or are lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves, they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.\n\nThe concept that many people today have of a \"feminist\" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. However, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout about the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism, they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the dominant gender and all men should adhere to their wishes, and call it feminism, then they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for radical women to get angry under, to shout from, and to feel safe within. Outsiders now see the feminist movement as a bunch of whining women who don't want equality but want dominance.", "speed": 0.4600930720074712, "eta": "00h09m18s"}

People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences. This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary. This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.\nSince its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion. Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were noticed and ridiculed, thus defeating their cause, because of their aggressive action. At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was therfore, detrimental to the good of society.\nAlthough \"radicals\" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards, the problem still exists. From the very beginning the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle. However, I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement, but rather, in the perception of those observing the movement. \nWhen Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. Immediately, the focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself. Those outside the movement could only see the differences between \"normality\" and Women's Lib.\nThis is still true twenty-five years later. Women supporting equal pay for women and and other \"liberal\" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s. The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals.\nSo what am I getting at?

Without money nothing works. We went off the barter system years ago. So if one wants to eat, have some where to sleep, have transportation and clothing, the almighty dollar is a must.\n\nIt's probably more correct to say that, \"Absolute power currupts absolute\". Once ones basic and comfort needs are met, what's next, power or the power to influence. This begats the will for more power and the cicle goes on. Unless the individual has a good work ethic and good sence, the power can become intoxicating to the point of it being the obsession that controls a person's life.\n\nAnything that comes easy most probably won't be as appreciated or valued as something that comes with effort. Money makes things happen, and quickly. If one has to work hard for their salary, they most likely will spend it more wisely than if someone always had plenty of money and never had to work for a living.\n\nThis brings up another theory of how people use money. Some use it to live and others live to use it. Money can be either a slave for us or it can make us slaves. Many people rate the quality of life and sucess by a dollar figure that they made last year. Others rate success one heir more substantive accomplishments that agree with their sense of values, of which money is not number one. The people who rate their success by that dollar figure also must compare and be competitive with others. The person who rates success on substantive accomplishments can stand alone and have self satisfaction.\n\nMoney is something that our society has made indespencable.

If someone has money does it make that person evil?\n\nI believe what they are trying to say is, you always want more that you have and the more you have the more you want. You want money, the things money can buy, and the power that goes with having money. This leads you away from the christian way of life and into a life of evil.\n\nA christian has a God centered life. The christian way of life is often thought of as being subservant, living without material things, and always thinking of those less fortunate than you. Having money and power are unimportant to the person who has God as the center of their life.\n\nIf you lead a life that is based on how much money you have, you are always searching for the next dollar you will get and how you will get it. Your family and friends will become unimportant and you can become consumed with obtaining more money. You can be lead into gambling and the life associated with gambling. As your need for more money increases you will do almost anything for it.\n\nMoney is not evil. Money is incapable of being evil since it is a mear piece of paper or coins and can not make judgements and decisions. It is the person whose judgements, decisions, and actions that can be evil.\n\nMoney can be used to lessen the hardships in life. It can purchase homes for the homeless, buy food and clothing for the poor. Money can provide opportunities to educated the uneducated which will enable them to be able to provide a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nIs money the root of all evil?

If someone possesses a significant amount of money, does it automatically make them evil?\n\nI believe that the underlying sentiment is that you always want more than what you currently have, and the more you have, the more you crave. This desire for money, along with the material possessions and power it brings, often leads individuals away from a Christian way of life and into a life of sin.\n\nFor a Christian, living a life centered around God is essential. Living a Christian life often involves prioritizing spiritual values over material wealth, and constantly thinking about those less fortunate. Having money and power are not important to those who place God at the center of their lives.\n\nIf one's life is solely focused on accumulating money, they are constantly searching for the next dollar and how to obtain it, often at the expense of family and friends.

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00.

Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that gets less attention than the other big problems in our society such as guns and drugs. Being that its a very sensitive, horrifying, and contraversal issue, its one of the less publically broadcast problem in society today. Suicide gets most of its attention only when its a well known public figure. Suicide used to be just an adult problem, but over the years suicide has decreased for all groups of people except young people <R>. Before 1960, there wasn't much literature about adolescent suicide, but after an epidemic of suicide clusters in the on-coming years and a steady rise in adolescent suicide, the media and researchers took notice <R>. From 1959 to 1982, suicide rates for the ages 15 through 24 jumped from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000 <R>. And in 1987, the age range of 15 through 19 rates were 10.3 alone <R>. Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>. In general, white males are the leading suicidal victims over any other race or gender, but adolescent suicide is still a major social problem for all races and genders, specifically black males and black and white females <*> <R>.\n\tDuring the years of this rise in adolescent suicide, there have been many works and studies done on this issue of adolescent suicide. These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening. There have also been many case studies done on individuals looking for the cause and effects of adolescent suicide, but a different way at looking at this problem and see the causes is to look at the problem theoretically.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Adolescent suicide is a major problem in our society that often receives less attention than other significant issues like guns and drugs. While drug abuse and crime are commonly perceived as the worst problems affecting young people today, suicide is arguably the most pressing. Being a very sensitive, horrifying, and controversial issue, it is one of the least publicly discussed problems in society. Suicide tends to get significant attention only when it involves well-known public figures. Historically, suicide was primarily an adult problem, but over the years, it has decreased among all groups except young people. Before 1960, there was little literature on adolescent suicide. However, after a series of suicide clusters and a steady rise in adolescent suicide rates, the media and researchers began to take notice. From 1959 to 1982, the suicide rates for those aged 15 to 24 increased from 4.9 per 100,000 to 12.1 per 100,000. By 1987, the rate for those aged 15 to 19 was 10.3 per 100,000. Although the number of adolescent suicides in recent years is remarkable, the rates of suicide attempts are even more alarming. The suicide attempt rates for individuals under 19 increased from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984. In general, white males are the leading victims of suicide, but adolescent suicide remains a significant social problem for all races and genders, particularly for black males and black and white females.\n\nDuring the rise in adolescent suicide rates, many works and studies have been conducted to address this issue from various angles. Researchers have looked at statistical data, focused on recognizing and preventing suicide, and conducted case studies to understand the causes and effects.

Food and shelter are fundamental needs a person must have in order to survive. A percentage of the population of the citizens of America lack these necessities. Homelessness has become an intense problem in the United States that must be solved. There is an agreement between all opposing viewpoints in government that something must be done that to combat homelessness.

What is true is that in the United States it is continually growing, and action must be taken immediately to alleviate the problem.\n      People living without shelter has been a problem in America since settlers from Europe came. Coming to America meant freedom and opportunity to the early settlers. They arrived in masses to the coast penniless and with no shelter. Throughout history this trend has continued. During the 19th century, industry in this country rose to new heights. Numerous factories developed, in these factories the workers had a great insecurity about their job permanence. Unemployment became a live threat to most working Americans. Impoverished people were interpreted negatively as seen in the book Homelessness: A Sourcebook by Rick Fantasia and Maurice Isserman which states that <*>. Cheap labor was a direct result of trying to distinguish between the homeless that deserved help and the ones that did not. The cheap labor was used in industry and it provided the authorities with an excuse to limit the funds that had been designated for the poor.\n      During the middle of the 19th century there was an increased desire to help the homeless. In this movement poorhouses were established. As  with the cheap labor, poorhouses were only available to the people that were the most \"deserving\" of the poor. This attempt did not help prevent homelessness. The establishement of poorhouses only separated the general public from the people without homes to a greater extent.

The computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories;  accounting, engineering, and other scientific programs, etc.  The effects of the computer have been tremendous; however, the phenomenon is a catch-22.  The computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint.\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen. In offices, the computer is everywhere. From word processors to spreadsheet/database programs, computers have made office work easier and faster.  Automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs. Also almost everyone has at least one simple computer, e.g. a calculator. There are of course many other things computers are used for, but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows (except for people in 2nd & 3rd world countries) how abundant computers are.\nThe mental effect of computers is two-fold. Firstly, computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do, many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works. This has created a surplus of \"needless\" computations, figures, etc. People can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer.  What many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time.  Granted, it is the person who \"told\" the computer what to do that truly made the error; however if that person knew what he should do, or better stated \"was able to do with a computer\", he would not have erroneous answers. Mathematical models, theories, etc. are absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people don't know or can't predict.  Due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many \"variables\".\nSecondly, computers have sometimes become more reliable than people.  A computer's circuits don't get tired and, if programmed 100% correctly (another perhaps impossible computation), never make errors.  This supposed reliability has left many workers out of work.  The effects of this are unpredictable.  Anger, frustration, fear, and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The modern microcomputer (PC) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace, transforming from the first modern computer in the 1940s to the sophisticated machines of today.

This, realistically, has been quite a new invention, and in its short life span has been able to change the world significantly. Not to mention how it will change people's life styles in the future. These changes resulting from the invention of the computer, have been, I feel both bad and good.\n\tTechnologically, computers have improved people's lives drastically. No longer are the times when people must write a paper manually, or even with a simple typewriter. Personal computers are becoming quite common, and therefore less expensive and easier to own. Computers have also made live transpire much quicker than before. Gone are the days when a person who wanted money from a bank had to wait until it was open. We now have ATM, automatic teller machines that are able to proceed with the same transactions as a teller would do. It seems these days EVERYTHING is run by computers! We are able to complete our tasks much better and much more efficiently. Basically every facet of life has been affected by computers bringing about positive results.\n\tWhile computers have brought about improvements, in my opinion, they also have \"impersonalized\" the world. Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \"fast enough\". Interraction with humans in some places is extinct. Yes, it might be more efficient to have a computer make your transaction at a bank, but I miss the human interraction between people. In addition, it is also very dangerous to place all of one's trust in a  machine. It is a common fact machines do fail! Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires. Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions, and therefore are incapable, in some instances to function.

This new invention, despite its short life span, has managed to reshape the world in profound ways. These changes, I believe, will continue to alter people's lifestyles even more in the future.\n\nTechnologically, computers have improved people's lives drastically. No longer do we need to write papers manually or rely solely on typewriters. Personal computers have become increasingly common, making them less expensive and easier to own. Computers have also made our lives much more efficient. For instance, gone are the days when a person needed to wait until a bank was open to withdraw money. Now, we have automated teller machines (ATMs) that can perform the same transactions as a teller. It seems that almost every aspect of life has been affected by computers, bringing about positive results. We can now complete our tasks more efficiently and effectively.\n\nHowever, while computers have brought about improvements, they have also \"impersonalized\" the world in my opinion. Jobs are being taken away from humans who are not \"fast enough,\" and human interaction in some places is virtually extinct. Yes, it might be more efficient to have a computer handle a transaction at a bank, but I miss the human interaction between people. Furthermore, it is dangerous to place all trust in machines. Machines do fail, and this can have severe consequences. For example, a car with a computer that alerts the driver to an oncoming obstacle is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own judgment? People may soon stop thinking critically and allow machines to do the work for them. I am concerned about our heavy reliance on a complex network of wires and circuits.\n\nWith the invention of the computer, we have seen many changes from the past to future lifestyles. Some of these changes are life-saving, such as advancements in medical technology and safety measures. Others, however, bring about a sense of impersonalization and the potential for failure. The future will undoubtedly bring even more changes, and it is up to us to navigate them thoughtfully.", "speed": 0.4734707254906748, "eta": "00h07m55s"}

I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual.  Every individual holds a different perspective of life and what they consider to be valuable and important.

In the past this type of discrimination, which includes more then blacks African Americans, but also other ethnicities and women, has been excepted as a way of life. Few individuals have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes, and inequality, and demand freedom and equality.  Numerous hidden talents, strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society.  However, today we are beginning to move in a new direction.  People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be unlearned.

Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered. The philosopher's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust.\n\tSince it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [24 hours = day] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it. Although I don't claim to understand relativity, I've attempted to indwell the topic [like sidphantha and his rock]. The point is my notion of time has changed; And I think once humanity realizes that time-notions are human constructions and are subject to change, that then the impact of Einstien's idea will be felt. For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien's \"invention\" for intentions not worthy of the genius; namely: atomic bombs.\n\tThe significance of atomic bombs cannot be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century.

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too. Unfortunately, wars have used airplanes. Japan bombing Pearl Habor, for example, and the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Japan.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The invention of the airplane, in my opinion, has drastically changed the lives of many people.

Though advances in communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk.  In the second of the world wars, the race was on to create the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known.  In my opinion, the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime, if not, perhaps, in several lifetimes.\n\tAs missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved, fear began to replace nationalism, and our small world erected barriers between its members.  From my experience as an American, I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat, Soviet citizens with anti-Christ, and bomb shelters, secret cities for underground, and weapons orbiting our planet, with daily, normal life.  Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear, cold war age.  In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues, my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing, improvement, and implementation.

With this, the walls, barbed wire, and mental barriers are falling, bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis.  Although the old habits die hard, they are indeed dying.

As a natural antibiotic, penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections.  This \"wonder-drug\" also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally-occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured \"in vitro\" in a laboratory.  This sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered.\n\tAs discoveries of new antibiotics decreased, chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine.  It was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally-occurring antibiotics through synthesis.  Both of these new attempts caused a need for more research, more companies, and more medical chemists, and the industry increased tremendously.  It was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active.  New drugs were also synthesized; some were found to be medically useful while others were not.  A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine.

Since the middle of the century the television has come in to our homes and changed our way of live.

This discovery of AIDS has changed how people think, live, and view mortality.  At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.

Some have had a great impact, while others have not. The computer however in this, the information age, has had a great impact on how society and especially business gathers, creates, responds to and, understands everyday information.\n\tThe computer has been around since the end of the Second World War. It was mainly used though, by corporations and government to process the huge amounts of information that they needed to gather. At that time the ordinary everyday person had no need to process information as we do today. As the world got more complex and people started to process and receive information that was much more sophisticated, they needed a tool in order to help them with it. No longer was a secretary and a typewriter enough to handle the ever increasing needs that technology and business put upon society.\n\tIn 1980 IBM Corporation started a revolution that today continues full force to dominate our everyday lives;  the invention of the personal computer. What the PC (personal computer) meant for society was an affordable tool that would help one sort out, save, delete or add and receive information in one's own home. This made it possible to write papers, look over databases, do your taxes and expense accounts, just about anything that you had to do. It was a way to organize your work and the information that you had to process in an easier fashion and much more quickly. Since 1980 there have been many advances in the technology that was first made available because of this machine. They got faster, more sophisticated, more programs were made available, and they soon became more compatible with other technologies. What this meant was that you now had a faster tool that could do more, receive more, and analyze more information than ever before. Today you can sit in your home at the terminal and create just about any form of document that you wish. You can use it to do just about any task you need it for.

Each decade in itself has introduced a new \"fad\" or discovery that has been fixed in our minds as \"typical\" of the era. The \"Roaring 20's\" for example was marked by flapper skirts and the invention of the automobile. A very capricious decade, it can be contrasted with the years of hunger and unemployment that marked the \"Great Depression\" of the 30's. How could we ever forget the \"Fabulous Fifties\" or the hippie decade of the 60's and 70's?

In fact, all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives.  If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention of the field, it would have to be the television.  Through the television, news and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening.

There are, however, several downsides to the television, and, like all inventions can be used in a useless way.\n\tNot even truly dealing with the amount of television that is watched by the average person, there are several other important ways that television had changed people's lives.  One interesting development has been the use of television in wars.  The vietnam war was the first time that U.S. citizens were able to really see what it was like to be at war.  This was one of the factors that led to much of the protesting.  We are able also to see for ourselves what is happening around the globe, and this has led to public concern and effort, for instance, in Somalia.  Of course radio was already able to transmit the sound, but the coming of the picture has had even more significance.\n\tThe greatest effect that television has had is that it has made smaller the dimensions of the planet.  Gone are the days of unknown and unheard of areas.  Television is able to bring any part of the world into your very living room within a matter of seconds.  It is also a very influential and powerful device in that it is the easiest way in which to communicate with populations.  There are many who feel that it can be a harmful thing, and this is true.  It is also used in ways that can desensitize one's sense of what is actually being portrayed because the picture itself is not real.

The extend to which this invention has altered people's lives is astronomical.  The airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people's perceptions of the entire world.

Today, people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future.\n\tPeople are concerned with nuclear weapons. We realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world. Also related to this topic is nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans;  it also kills animals & plants. We are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes & rivers. Companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w/o being heavily fined.\n\tPeople have also become concerned with nature. We used to assume our natural resources were never ending. Now, though, we realize what we use, needs to be replaced. For example deforestation is a very big issue, many groups have formed to plant more trees. We also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively.\n\tAnother important topic we are all aware of is recycling. This links 2 issues, one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products & the other of reusing what we have. (Recycling in a small way also helps those w/o homes b/c they receive money for their collections). Many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment.\n\t Another important issue is that of conserving energy. In the past, once again, we assumed our energy was never ending. Now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they're not in their rooms, to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources. We realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money.\n\tWe have also become more considerable of our animal life. We are no longer able to kill animals freely. We do still raise some for food but hunting is limited & we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction. One realizes that animals have rights too.\n\tIn conclusion, the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one. We are slowly becoming more aware & are beginning to take more precautions.

People today are increasingly aware of the importance of environmental protection to our future. This concern extends to several areas, including nuclear weapons and nuclear waste.\n\nNuclear weapons and their associated dangers are a primary concern. Countries with large arsenals have the power to destroy the world, and this awareness has led to efforts to limit these weapons. Nuclear waste, which is not only harmful to humans but also to animals and plants, is another major issue. Consequently, there is a fight for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers, with companies no longer able to dump their waste without heavy fines.\n\nNature conservation is also a growing concern. The realization that our natural resources are not limitless has led to changes in our practices. Deforestation is a significant issue, and many groups have formed to plant more trees. We are also becoming more conscious of the need to use our fossil fuels more conservatively.\n\nRecycling is another critical issue that has gained widespread attention. It addresses two main problems: reducing the production of nonbiodegradable products and reusing what we have. Recycling benefits both the economy and the environment. For example, it can provide income for those without homes by paying for collected items. Many countries have acknowledged the importance of recycling, recognizing its positive impact on both their economy and the environment.\n\nConserving energy is another area of growing concern. We are no longer taking our energy sources for granted. People are now more inclined to turn off lights when they are not needed, to avoid leaving taps running, and to generally reduce their consumption of natural resources. This practice not only benefits the environment but also saves money.\n\nOur growing consideration for animal life is another significant change. We are no longer able to kill animals freely. While some animals are still raised for food, hunting is limited, and there is widespread awareness of the risks of animal extinction.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.  However, this sense of reality is not so distorted, and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman.  As long as one has a well-developed sense of reality, TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "An invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people's lives is television.

Many people buy them to take with them wherever they go so they can receive a call at any time.  They are a complete luxury and not a necessity.\n\tThe cellular telephone has changed people's lives in many ways: the main way being the availability to be reached at any time.  Communication is readily available in cars & on the streets now.  People are able to use their car phones in case of an emergency; if they are stranded or broken down.  They can take their cellular phones on vacations & to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call.  To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\tAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone.  When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident.  This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them.  So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them.  Cellular telephones are also very expensive. They are expensive to buy, to install and to use. Whether you are making a call from the cellular phone or receiving a call, it costs a lot of money.  Although most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone, can afford to pay the bills!\n\tThe other day I called my father in his office, from Madrid -  On his \"party line\" he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone.  I find it truly amazing that it is possible to speak with 4 people at once, especially when one person is in Spain and another is in a car!!  It is truly a mark of great expansion in technology.\nEach year a new amazing product astonishes me even more.

While they are a luxury and not a necessity, they have significantly changed people's lives in numerous ways.\n\nThe primary way in which cellular telephones have impacted people's lives is by providing constant availability for communication. Now, people can stay connected in cars and on the streets, ensuring that they can be reached at any moment. For instance, in emergencies, such as when someone is stranded or their car breaks down, they can use their car phones. Additionally, people can take their cellular phones with them on vacations or to their friends' houses if they are expecting an important call. This accessibility, while often deemed unnecessary by some, is seen as essential by many.\n\nAnother significant impact of cellular telephones is the increase in accident rates among those who talk on their phones while driving. When someone is more focused on their phone conversation than on the road, they are more likely to get into an accident, especially in heavy traffic. This issue is compounded by the high cost of cellular phones. They are expensive to buy, install, and use, both for calls made and received. Despite the expense, most people who can afford to buy a cellular phone can manage the costs.\n\nOne day, while calling my father at his office in Madrid, he was able to connect my sister in Santa Barbara and my mother in Los Angeles on her car phone.

Carolina was getting their butts beat bad and with just fourteen seconds left on the clock before halftime, coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout so that Florida could score again. Carolina was already losing by four touchdowns. Florida did score with two seconds left. He wasn't done yet because in the fourth quarter Florida was faced with a fourth down and two situation twice and Steve went for it both times each time getting the first down. They eventually scored. The final score was Florida 63 and the Gamecocks 7. I know I made Steve Spurrier sound like a jerk, but who could blame him.

It holds many different beliefs for different groups of people.  Some view it as a symbol of pride and a heritage that should not be forgotten.

The flag that is currently over the state house is the battle flag.  It is the flag that is red with blue bars, with stars in them, crossing through the center of it.  In my mind that stands for the South fighting to keep slavery.  It is the flag that the South would carry into battle.  It does not represent the southern way of life, but rather short bursts of fury raging against those who wanted to do away with slavery.\nThe real Confederate flag is much different.

Some people are very relieved and others are very shocked that Susan Smith did not recieve the death penalty. The news media and many individuals have stated facts as well as opinions, I would like to express my opinion on the justness of the sentence handed down to Susan Smith.\nSusan Smith has had a very disturbing life as a child. Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty. Death would have been quick, easy, and more economical. Susan Smith is now living with a guilty conscience, a sentence that is far greater than death. She will have to live knowing that she is the reason her two sons, Michael and Alex Smith are gone forever.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In 1994, Susan Smith, a mother from Union, South Carolina, chose to end the lives of her two young sons by loading them into her car and driving it into a nearby lake.

Drugs are here to stay whether anyone likes it or not.  It would be nearly impossible to completely eliminate all of the different drug uses.  People will always find some kind of over-the-counter drug or inhalants, to get high off of.  The legalization of some drugs like marijuana would improve many different aspects of society.\nHealth problems seem to be a concern as far as legalization goes.  Issues such as permanent damage to the brain and other parts of the anatomy.  The fact is that people are going to use drugs anyway, so why not regulate the pureness of some of these drugs.  A majority of drugs relate to or have deadly effects.  Most people do not see marijuana as a drug.  They view it like cigarettes.  Marijuana is probably one of the lease harmful of drugs.  The side effects of marijuana is not apparent as some other drugs.  I do not feel as strongly about legalizing crack cocaine as others.  There are some other things legal today, which can have potentially deadly results.  Lung cancer from cigarette smoke, liver failure from the abuse of alcohol, and the potential loss of teeth and gum damage from chewing tobacco.\n\tIf marijuana among other drugs were legalized, should there be an age limitation? If children obeyed the law, it would be a good idea.  However, they do not.  An age limit would probably just encourage kids to see if they could\nstill get drugs.  Today, kids like to take risks even though there are enormous consequences when caught.  Sometimes, I feel there is a need to eliminate the drinking and cigarettes age law.  I do not know of many people under the age of twenty-one and eighteen that can not get a hold of some alcohol beverages and cigarettes and other tobacco products when they want to.  At my high school the people who were caught smoking underage received the same punishment as the people old enough to smoke.  People will start these habits at young ages, even though it is illegal.  It also starts kids to be interested in fake identification cards.  The product of having these cards is illegal, but it does not stop anyone.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Some people believe that action is needed to address drug use, and most published works focus on decreasing it.

The legalization of certain drugs, such as marijuana, could improve various aspects of society.\n\nHealth concerns are a significant issue regarding drug legalization. The potential for permanent brain damage and other serious physical harm is a critical concern. The fact remains that people will continue to use drugs, so it might be more beneficial to regulate the purity of certain substances. Many drugs have deadly effects, and while marijuana is often viewed differently by society, it is generally considered one of the least harmful. The side effects of marijuana are not as apparent as those of other drugs.\n\nWhile some argue that marijuana should be legalized, my stance on drugs like crack cocaine is different. There are other substances legal today, such as cigarettes and alcohol, that can have deadly results. Cigarettes can cause lung cancer, alcohol can lead to liver failure, and tobacco can damage teeth and gums.\n\nIf marijuana and other drugs were to be legalized, should there be an age limit? An age restriction could be beneficial, but in practice, it might only encourage younger people to seek out these substances. Kids are known for taking risks, and an age limit might just make it more appealing to try and get drugs at an early age. Today, it's not uncommon for teenagers to obtain alcohol and cigarettes, regardless of the legal age restrictions. This often leads to the creation of fake identification cards, which are illegal but do not stop anyone from accessing these products.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the health impacts of drug legalization, the reality is that people will continue to use drugs.

Instead of viewing the enjoyment of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allow the enjoyment of the differences to increase social well. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlining driving force of opposite sex interaction.

There are many reasons why there should be a salary cap. For one, most of the professional football players make more money than a college graduate does. Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime.

There are numerous compelling reasons to support this idea. For one, most professional football players earn significantly more than a typical college graduate.

Third, a salary cap would ensure that players' earnings are not determined by the previous year's performance, thereby promoting a level playing field.\n\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? Not necessarily. Despite often dedicating years to their education, a college graduate might not make as much as a professional football player. While a football player is globally recognized, does his job's significance truly surpass that of a doctor or nurse, who works tirelessly to save lives? A professional football player, in just his first year, can gain more fame and honor than a doctor who has dedicated decades to their profession. This imbalance is problematic. We need doctors to maintain our health, but do we really need professional football players to amuse us? \n\nAmericans need to reflect on what is truly essential in life. While we can do without sports, we cannot live without doctors. Which profession is considered more important by the average American? Given the substantial earnings of professional football players, it appears that they are more highly valued than doctors. A professional football player can make more in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this fair? In many ways, it is not. Doctors must work diligently to reach their careers, while football players merely need to run and catch balls. A person does not have to be academically gifted to be a football player; they just need to have the physical abilities. The amount of money professional football players make in a year is so excessive that no one can use it all in their lifetime. Some of this money could be better utilized for charitable causes.", "speed": 0.44704282427665487, "eta": "00h07m11s"}

I can't remember a time when I have turned on the television and not watched a movie, with a great deal of sex in it. Some of the best shows on television, according to the ratings are shows where everyone sleeps with everyone. Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place are prime examples of overrated sex in the media. In these two shows, if everyone isn't sleeping with everyone else, then the characters are not happy. On Beverly Hills, 90210, everyone on that show has or will have slept with everyone else, by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where sex is everywhere.\nWe also have radio. Now radio is almost as bad as television. Every time I turn on the radio, I either hear a man or a woman saying how things would be alright, if you just make love. Then again some songs don't even have to be listened to, to realize they are talking about sex. \"Sex Me\", by R. Kellye, bluntly saids what the song is about. \"I'll Make Love to You\", by Boyz II Men is another obvious one. Now, these songs don't even have to be heard, just read the titles to know what the song is about. Television and radio are not the only places sex is overrated.\n\tMagazines are also in the large number of those who promote sex. \tAlmost every magazine I have ever read, has ads f eaturing sex. These ads use sex to sell everything from shampoo to cologne. In these ads we have half nude men and women, either by themselves or together promoting sex to sell something. There are these Paul Mitchell shampoo ads, which should probably show the model\u00b4s head, because all we need to see is her hair. Instead, they show a model lying down with a sheet wrapped around her body. Nothing but a sheet. Now if I'm not mistaken, shampoo is used to wash your hair not your whole body, so why show her half dressed body. \"Gravity\", a cologne for men, has ads with a man kissing on a woman, both half dressed, soak and wet on a beach.

The most common time for a child to watch a program that should be screened from them is when dad is at work and mom is in the kitchen cooking or cleaning. Children starting at age four, generally watch what looks interesting to them. Children like to watch what they call 11 Big people shows\". Those kinds of shows not only interest the children but make the children to want to experiment and do what the people on the shows do. Watching \"Big people shows\" makes the child feel older and grown up. Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch. If you spread that out in a seven day period that's about two programs a day. Let us start when a child gets home from school at\nout three o'clock. On one channel at three o'clock a soap opera is on which has sex, violence, and profanity. At four o'clock Opra talk show is on which has sex and profanity usually. At five o'clock Ricki Lake talk show is on which has sex and profanity. After her show we have the News a game show and then a nigh time soap opera. By this time it's nine o'clock and time for the child to go to bed and out of six hours there was one thirty minute game show that is fit for a child to watch. With these television programs on every day the child starts to watch his or her favorite show and once interested then wants to experiment.

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of a patient's\nrecovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

The most political stance to take on this situation would be to say it's a drug and it should be thought of as an illegal substance. Although, that is the most political stance we all know that most politicians who set these laws up use drugs themselves. Over the last few years I've noticed a rise in the popularity of weed. My first time ever seeing weed was when I was a little kid. I didn't know exactly what it was, but I knew that it was a really odd smelling cigarette. When I got older I found out that my mom and my dad smoked weed when they were younger.\nI always told myself that even though they did it back in the 70's it still wasn't right. I am a product of the just say no age. From way back when I was in the third grade the schools have been pounding it in my head \"Just Say No\". I never gave it any thought I figured the world was set up so that if you stayed off and away from drugs you would live a better life. As I got older I realized that this was not true. The people that I know who sell marijuana had nice clothes and drove nice cars. The Columbian suppliers make millions every year. The American government officials who see and don't see make mega bucks, and most of these officials are the same guys who keep weed illegal.\nAs I got older and found out more about this mixed up world I came to realize that in european countries you can buy weed like you buy a pack of cigarettes. At first I thought this was extremely odd. In my mind weed was a drug I had seen it as a young kid but I had never actually inspected it. I didn't really know what marijuana was. Then one day I a conversation with this Jamaican man that we called Black Mosses.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Society has a double standard for women, a legacy that stems from the past when women were strictly confined to the home and men were the breadwinners and heads of households. The roots of this double standard can be traced back to an era where women had limited societal roles, primarily under the dominance of men. People of older generations, who lived through the early stages of the feminist movement, were among the first to experience the push for women's equality. Back in the early 1900s, women held only one place in society, subordinated under the dominant rule of men. At that time, men served as leaders in households and communities, a role that had been established long ago. The status quo seemed fine until women began to assert their equality and demand respect.\n\nThe Bible emphasizes that God created Adam before Eve, reinforcing the idea that the male is the leader. This belief is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of male society, women were often perceived as docile, fragile, and emotional, leading some to treat them as delicate pets. Women's roles were confined to being present in the home, raising children, and obeying their husbands without question.

This event is the shutdown of the United States government and it will not end until government officials. decide to work together and solve the problem that started this whole ordeal.

Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.\nIn many ways this division in power can be good.

One the most potent solvents has been the practice of premarital sex. Premarital sex in itself, physically, does little or no harm in its action. The real problems come soon after and have long ranging affects. It is without any doubt that premarital sex is overall destructive because it leads to the lost of respect for women, the birth of illegitimate communities, and even the spread of sexually transmitted disease. Science and government have tried to curb many of these problems, but unfortunately, they never come to the realization that the only way to accomplish that goal is to cut down on have sex before marriage.\nPremarital sex is a problem which did not begin yesterday. It didn't begin ten, twenty, or thirty-five years ago either, but premarital sex has truly changed during that time. The major change, of course, coming thirty-five years ago with the start of the \"Sexual Revolution\" in the sixties. This revolution brought about a sexual awareness. No longer was sex going to be a dark issue. Men and women became more educated about their bodies, how to prevent disease, how to better plan their families, and how to perform better in their sexual roles. Other reforms in gender and racial equality helped keep the revolution rolling. Unfortunately, as with many things, all the good things brought about by greater sexual education had there bad side affects. Side affects like the lowering of moral standards and the loss of person responsibility have made sexual revolution buzz words for when America headed down the toilet. People were given power over their sex and their sexuality, but they lost control of themselves. That power has corrupted people into thinking they can have it all for free. As far as premarital sex is involved, the idea is that \"the reward would be granted before the price was paid, and if this reward were the only thing desired why should one pay the price of marriage after enjoying intercourse\" (Reiss 175) has become prominent. While it is true that sex is not the only thing involved in marriage, other than a legal commitment to live together, there are few other differences between being engaged and being married.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The foundation of this nation, and the world as a whole, has crumbled greatly, and one of the most potent solvents has been the practice of premarital sex.

These are the same questions that college football has to face every year and every year these questions seem to be getting more difficult to answer. The college football polls don't seem to have the answer to these questions because there is always some debated over who should be ranked number 1 even after the bowl games. However, college football can develop a playoff system and keep their bowl games at the same time. The simple solution to solving one of college football's most complicated situations, the selection of a national championship team, is to have a playoff system in which the top teams compete for the top spot. A playoff system will generate more revenue, create more excitement for the fans because they will be able to see some of their dream match-ups, and most importantly, it will determine a true champion and a true number 1 for college football.\nIn the 1992-93 college football season, the University of Alabama won the national championship but not without some type of argument from other fans and poll writers. Before Alabama even played the University of Miami in the 1993 Sugar Bowl with the winner earning the national title, there were some poll writers and fans arguing that it should be Florida State and Miami playing in the Fiesta Bowl for the national title. Florida State had 1 loss in their record and that was to the Miami Hurricanes. Many poll writers and fans were saying that Florida State was arguably playing the best football in the country at the end of the regular season and they believed that Florida State should have jumped Alabama in the polls from number 3 to number 2 so that they could play Miami for the national championship. Some poll writers had a good argument that Florida State could have jumped Alabama in the polls because near the end of the regular season, Alabama struggled to the Florida Gators, a team that Florida State dismantled a week earlier.

These training programs would help most women who have been on welfare for years. \"These women have so little work experience that they have to rehearse with social workers to remember to say 'good-bye' and 'thank you' at the end of an interview\" (Whitman 30).\n\nIn Chicago, a highly regarded training program, Project Match, has given a mix of education, training, counseling, and job placement to its clients and has helped half of them get off welfare (Economist 33). Another success story of these programs is that of Princess Rowell. She has been on welfare for nine years and lost half of her $517 welfare payment for refusing to look for a job.", "speed": 0.44923057184876986, "eta": "00h05m58s"}

With an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily, the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern. Television programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations (Hepburn 1).

Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show. Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised, but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager?\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence' pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1).

There are many possible ways for this to be achieved, one of which being recycling.  Recycling would include not just the standard aluminum cans and paper bags but also plastic, steel, glass, refrigerators, batteries, and so on. In order for this world to be one that our children and grandchildren can benefit from, recycling needs to become commonplace uniformly.  Before every landfill and dump site is exhausted, the human population needs to educate themselves on the few, simple steps that can be taken to maximize the room that is left in landfills for recyclable materials.\n\"Most plastic can be recycled and collection for plastics is increasing rapidly' (Recycler's Bill of Rights 1).  This includes but is not limited to; plastic bags, containers, cups, toys and hangars.  All plastic products have recycling codes on them somewhere, on the bottom.  The codes have different meanings because if plastics are mixed, it can ruin the melt (Recycler's 1).  Most types of plastic grocery bags can be mixed together.  Even some bags that contain bread, pasta, and marshmallows can be recycled together.  Many plastic products such as compact discs, video tapes, and computer discs are made from mixed materials which can't be recycled unless first disassembled (Recycler's 1).  Corporations that produce grocery bags are starting to realize the importance of being environmentally friendly.  The Superbag Corporation produces their bags with a significant amount of recycled material.  The finished product is completely recyclable and this material can be used in a number of ways (Superbag 1).  Plastic bags are much better for the environment than paper bags because their production is better for the natural\nresources.\nThe brown paper bags used in some supermarkets are made from virgin paper, without contributions from recycled materials.  Paper making pollutes the water, releases dioxin, contributes to acid rain and costs trees ... Heretical as it may sound, some uses of virgin paper can be more damaging to wildlife than plastic substitutes . . . If they (consumers) support virgin paper bags over plastic bags, they are implicitly supporting higher levels of pollution (Superbag 1).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "A significant controversy has emerged globally, particularly in the United States, concerning the preservation of the environment for future generations.

One may assume that the NFL and its tax-subsidized teams no longer owe any loyalty to their fans.\n\nThe Houston Oilers will leave Houston for Nashville at the end of the 1995 season to become the Tennessee Cherokees. The Los Angeles Raiders left Los Angeles for Oakland, while the Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis. Why is this happening? And now, the 54-year-old Cleveland Browns plan to leave Cleveland to become the Baltimore Browns. Is this right? Is business just business, or do fans, tradition, and loyalty count?\n\nThe City of Cleveland has been known as a dump city for over two decades. Yet, they never really cared what anyone else thought. They started beautifying the city in the late 1980s, and now the changes are evident. They spent $440 million on the Gateway Project to build new facilities in downtown Cleveland for their baseball team (The Cleveland Indians) and their basketball team (The Cleveland Cavaliers). Project Gateway opened two years ago. They also spent nearly $80 million on Cleveland's brand new Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which opened this year. Now, they are constructing a novel Science Museum in downtown Cleveland. Bob Costas of NBC's sports called it \"The Renaissance of Cleveland.\"\n\nAll of this would be shattered in just one day when Art Modell announced that he was taking his Cleveland Browns elsewhere. The fans of Cleveland did not deserve this abdication. They were sold out for dollars and cents and were not even given time to make a counteroffer.", "speed": 0.44923057184876986, "eta": "00h05m58s"}

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In an age when government funding cuts loom on the horizon like an ominous storm cloud, many ponder which area of government spending will be reduced next. While some areas, such as defense cuts, might seem justified due to the current lack of an imminent threat from another superpower, there are other areas that should either maintain or receive increased support. One such area is government support for the arts, both visual and performing.\n\nWhy should the arts deserve government support? A fundamental reason lies in their role as a cultural interpreter and a lasting depiction of human thought. Throughout history, from the earliest cave and wall drawings to contemporary art forms, humans have sought to express their world in ways that endure through generations. These artistic expressions serve as windows into the past, allowing future generations to glimpse the values and thoughts of their forebears. Similarly, art helps us communicate with one another and our values. For instance, consider the French monarchs Louis XIV and XVI, who used decorative arts to showcase the glory of France, aiming to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns. This historical context underscores the importance of art in perpetuating cultural legacies.\n\nMoreover, art plays a crucial role in daily communication and community building. Even simple children\u2019s drawings can convey ideas in a universally understandable manner. Verbal skills are secondary; instead, these drawings focus on basic ideas in a form that is easily interpretable by all. Art also unites communities in a manner akin to team sports. Members of a ballet troupe, for example, bond through their collaborative efforts to produce high-quality performances, fostering camaraderie and even friendships. For art patrons, shared appreciation of the arts can also lead to the formation of friendships and connections based on a common interest. Thus, the arts serve not only as a bridge between past and present but also as a unifying force within communities.", "speed": 0.44923057184876986, "eta": "00h05m58s"}

I feel that, as a woman, there should be strict rules regarding abortions.\nWe all know the consequences of sex, especially unprotected sex and if a person decides to play the game they should be held accountable for the results of their horseplay. I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method that should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.\nWith all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the right to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child. Why can't these women just carry out the pregnancy and put the child up for adoption. Also, some people use money as their excuse. They say they can not afford to have a child.

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that has been the subject of constant debate for over two decades, with no sign of the discussions abating. This ongoing controversy stems from two fundamentally different perspectives on the subject. The central question in this debate is whether abortion should be legal. This question is crucial because it directly impacts human lives.\n\nWhile some individuals may feel detached from this issue, it is almost impossible for anyone to remain neutral, as opinions on this topic are widespread. People tend to align themselves with one of two categories: pro-choice or pro-life. However, it is often challenging to determine which side truly possesses the necessary knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. Therefore, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely to the woman in the situation. She is the only one who understands her circumstances and the potential consequences, both for herself and the child.\n\nBoth pro-choice and pro-life advocates have presented various points to support their stance. However, many of these arguments are not particularly strong. For example, some anti-abortion activists argue that rape is a situation where a woman has no control and that forcing her to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term is unjust. This argument overlooks the plight of women who are unwillingly impregnated, demonstrating a tendency to ignore special cases. Such perspectives make the anti-abortion argument seem unrealistic and impractical.\n\nAnother common argument by anti-abortion activists is the Slippery Nazi Slope. This argument claims that accepting abortion is akin to the Nazis' systematic extermination of Jews. The argument posits that a society that permits abortion is justifying a form of genocide. While this may sound compelling, it is not a substantial argument when examined closely. The true definition of genocide involves the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial, or cultural group, not individual decisions regarding pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over abortion is rooted in differing moral views and experiences. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the woman facing the situation, as only she can fully comprehend the implications and make an informed choice based on her unique circumstances.", "speed": 0.44923057184876986, "eta": "00h05m58s"}

Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are usually pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.\nCommercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, \"Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman,\" the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads have white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.\nPink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed in pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are usually dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would not want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. So if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.\nCommercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girls and Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies for girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.\nAlso baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs are also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys. A specific example is the Gerber bottles and dishes.\nAs for males, baby boys especially, blue is the\nstereotypical color. Baby boys are associated with blue.

Currently capital punishment is being left up to the individual state as to whether or not they decide to implement it as a form of punishment.  Advocates of this obscene form of punishment offer a handful of reasons justifying it's use.  At first glance these reasons seem to hold up, but one by one I will show you that these reasons are as ridiculous as the source they are trying to endorse.  Ounce society is enlightened of these statistics, they will see that capital punishment has no place in the justice of\nthis country.\nThe first claim of supporters is that they are under the opinion that it is much more expensive to keep a convicted criminal in prison for life than to simply pull their plug.  At first glance this statement seems to be more than rational.  The problem here is that people don't realize the big picture of the situation at hand.  Instead of capital punishment saving tax payers money, it actually does the complete opposite.  Let me throw a couple of statistics at you that I gathered doing a paper last year.  Currently to administer capital punishment upon a single individ ual it costs five times the amount than it would to inprison somebody from the age of eighteen to eighty years old.  How this statement can be valid is due to the reasons that when someone recieves the death penalty they are not killed the next day.  Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years.  During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals.  These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs.  When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system.  This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system.  So if the cost of punishment is at all a concern for you, then it is obvious that capital punishment is the wrong\ndirection to go.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Capital punishment has been a subject of debate since early hangings, and will continue to be a topic of controversy until society identifies the irrationality of its existence in our judicial system.

I will provide statistics from a paper I wrote last year to illustrate this point.

The reason for this discrepancy is that, when someone receives the death penalty, they are not executed immediately. Instead, they are placed on death row, which, on average, lasts over 18 years. During this time, the convicted criminal goes through numerous appeals, which are extremely expensive due to high court costs.

I refused to take a subscription to their paper. Several years ago I considered myself to be an avid reader. However lately, I feel the quality of their news has begun to go down. I remember last year when I was- interviewed by a representative of \"The State\", on the patio of the Russell House. I told them at that time that they had lost the quality of their news, and the price was just too high for what they had in their paper.\nOver the passing years, I have come to know a \"new media.\" It is no longer the media of my younger years. Then, newspapers, radio and television were successfiil without dragging up all kinds of dirt on any and every person or event that came along.\nI guess my realization of this \"right to know\" came when United States troops were sent into Grenada in the 1980's. The media's \"right to know' was unknowingly broadcasting troop movements to the enemy, endangering the fives of our young people. As a parent of one of these young people, I was appalled and infuriated. How dare they endanger lives with their \"right to know\". It happened again in Desert Storm and Bosnia. What happened to waiting for the battle to end before the cameras and lights went on? I suppose this might come under the people's 'right to know\", however, I am sure they would hope that the sons and daughters they sent to fight, would at least have a small chance of surviving the first impact before someone told the enemy where they were. Watch out, future warriors of this country. It may be your turn to step up in front of a camera when you least expect it. \nIn the early 1990's, the United States was looking for a new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders. The media took a perfectly good candidate, who probably would have made an excellent Surgeon General, and dug up as much dirt on him as possible.

That questions is should women be allowed to attend the Citadel. There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the past few years, one question has repeatedly appeared in the courts: should women be allowed to attend the Citadel? While there have been many objections to this statement, there are also many strong advocates who believe in the inclusion of women.\n\nWhenever asked why women shouldn't be admitted, two primary reasons often come up. First, it is argued that the Citadel has traditionally been an all-male institution. Second, it is said that women lack the ability to handle the challenges it presents. It is true that the Citadel has been a male-only institution, but as the saying goes, traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken, you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives, and so on. As society evolves, its traditions must evolve along with it. Over time, certain things fade away, and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to make it more equal. While people might like to believe that we live in an equal society, as a woman, I know that is not entirely true. Society has certainly changed for the better, but we are not there yet. Men are just like women; some may be strong or intelligent, while others may not. A woman could do a job as well as a man or as poorly as a man. This brings us to the conclusion that women cannot handle the duties of attending the Citadel because they are inherently worse suited for it. I will not say that all women could, because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people argue that women do not have enough physical strength, but others might be capable of handling the challenges.

The Citadel, being publicly funded, should follow the same rules as other schools. If all public schools started to say they only accept students from a specific ethnicity or nationality, our educational system would be in chaos.

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and it remains a critical issue that is not going away anytime soon.

Many people believe it should be illegal. Many others believe the government should not interfere; it should remain the choice of the individual. Hapeo povertyg personal choice and illegal abortions are examples why people should maintain their right to decide. Abortion is the right of the people and it should remain so.\nOne in four women experience rape or attempted rape in their life time. Imagine being forced to carry the child of a man who assaulted you and then being force to give birth to this child. Would be able to love him or her? This traumatic event takes months or years to recover from. Without the right to an abortion many of these women would require more time to recover and more counseling that they would already be receiving.\nMost unwanted pregnancies occur in poverty stricken areas of society. Generally children born into impoverished environments remain in that socioeconomic level their entire life.\nLower income families also tend to have five children on average while middle and upper income families tend to have only two children. By offering abortion to the lower income people you are helping to maintain a balance of the number of- lower income families and middle and upper income families. \nWomen deserve the right to have an abortion. they won this right in the case of Rowe versus Way. This was a landmark victory for pro-choice women across America. Without this case women would probably not be able to make the choice today.\nNo one should be able to decide whether or not another person should be allowed to have an abortion. This includes religious people and the government itself, because if the remove this right who is to say they will not try to remove other rights eventually.\nIf abortion were to be outlawed again would this end the practice'? No many women would continue to seek abortions whether it be by some unsanitary underground \"clinic\" or on their own with some primitive tool like a coat hanger or similar device.

Abortion should remain a right of the people.\n\nConsider the experiences of women who have faced rape or attempted rape. One in four women will encounter such trauma in their lifetime.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical/literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music. All these examples (and more) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know. \nThe stories told in this genre of literature, however, are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature. It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States. When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity. The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference.

The protagonist is singled out among the characters of the ethnic literature to convey the purpose of the author's work. Ethnic American literature implies that the ethnic protagonist's search for an identity within a society is not to set him apart from his culture selfishlessly, but to achieve, excell, and contribute to the culture of which he is associated. The protagonist is confused as to his role within society, but searches for that identity and role for the benefit of the many.\nThe protagonist is challenged by society to prove his value as an existing member. In that challenge, the character is faced with an examination of his or her role within the society. Celie, the protagonist of The Color Purple, must find inner strength to overcome the hardship placed on her by the male society. The desired result of the character's quest is not material wealth or spontaneous gratification, but a freedom to make a difference. Elie Wiesel pointed out that his autobiographical work Night was written to present a detailed account of the Jewish experience in the Nazi concentration camps, not to promote his own achievement in surviving.

Celie, the protagonist of The Color Purple, must find inner strength to overcome the hardships placed on her by the male society. The desired result of the character's quest is not material wealth or spontaneous gratification but a freedom to make a difference. In his autobiographical work Night, Elie Wiesel pointed out that his work was written to present a detailed account of the Jewish experience in the Nazi concentration camps, not to promote his own achievement in surviving. The important issue to examine in a protagonist's journey against society is the deference of gratification to the entire culture.", "speed": 0.44923057184876986, "eta": "00h05m58s"}

This clerk displayed a form of tolerance, but it was not genuine acceptance. Barbara Rieu Cleary further explains, as Barbara Rice also emphasizes, the need for all Americans to be more accepting of other cultures.\n\nReading ethnic American literature highlights the harm of nonacceptance and the desire for full integration. African Americans, through the words of their spirituals, express a clear longing to move to a better place where they are accepted. One spiritual song, for instance, says, \"We are bound for Canaan, it\u2019s a long way to go, but Lord I\u2019m bound for Canaan, for to be free.\" They sing about their desire to leave a place that does not accept them and to go where they will be accepted. Martin Luther King Jr. also stresses the importance of changing non-accepting attitudes in his rhetoric. He says, \"We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.\" King desires a world where all Americans accept each other as brothers and sisters. Similarly, in Philip Roth's *The Conversion of the Jews*, the character Ozzie pleads for acceptance when he cries, \"It\u2019s not just the Jews who died, Mom.\" He wants all deaths to be mourned, not just those of Jewish people. In Amy Tan's *The Joy Luck Club*, June in her struggle for acceptance tries to deny her Chinese heritage, but ultimately realizes that she cannot forget who she is. Her mother\u2019s endless tests to make June into a \"prodigy\" only serve to highlight the tension between her desire to fit in and her identity.\n\nNonacceptance in society is inherently harmful and can lead to deep-seated resentment and separation.

This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature cannot be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.", "speed": 0.45571562752107625, "eta": "00h04m43s"}

There was a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, that set guidelines for French literature. According to l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature.  However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.  \nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they did not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide \"kills\" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels.

The statistics in South Carolina support Lunde's thesis.The majority of the murders in SC are committed by friends, relatives, neighbors, or someone the victim knew. The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around. For example, a guy may get mad at his brother and then pick up a gun in a threatening-type way. He may have no intention of using it. But, as Berkowitz states the <*>. In his aggressive rage, he may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to the death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years. Various races are becoming more and more acceptable. However, racial prejudice is seen today in medical research. Certain studies are carried out on people of one race. Therefore, the research results may not be correct for all people. It may be that the classification of people for studies needs to change. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, 90% of homicide victims and their murderers were on a first name basis, indicating they knew one another well. This is supported by statistics in South Carolina, where the majority of murders are committed by friends, relatives, or neighbors. The factors contributing to these tragedies include frustration and aggression. Often, a person's anger can escalate into violent behavior. For instance, a person may become enraged at another and pick up a gun in a threatening manner. As Berkowitz states, in instances of extreme aggression, a person might kill unintentionally. Another significant factor in these high numbers of homicides is the widespread availability of guns in homes and on the streets, which can turn a minor altercation into a fatal one. For example, a child might use a gun, unaware of its lethality, leading to tragic consequences.\n\nRacial prejudice remains prevalent today, albeit in different forms compared to 30 years ago. One form is aversive racism, where a person avoids minorities to avoid expressing their prejudices openly. Another relatively new form is symbolic racism, where individuals associate specific racial groups with social problems. For example, some people believe that most welfare recipients are black, thus portraying them as lazy and unwilling to work. However, this is not accurate, as most welfare recipients are actually white.\n\nAnother aspect of racial prejudice has evolved, but has notably declined over the past three decades. Racial diversity has generally become more accepted, yet racial bias still manifests in medical research. Certain studies often focus on one racial group, leading to results that may not be applicable to other racial groups. This suggests that the categorization of participants in such studies may need to be reconsidered to ensure more inclusive and accurate research.", "speed": 0.45571562752107625, "eta": "00h04m43s"}

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, an astounding 90% of homicides involve individuals who were acquainted before the incident.

In one study, students were equally likely to help both black and white students who had demonstrated effort.

In contrast, the same students were likely to help white students regardless of effort, assuming outside factors had prevented them from preparing.\n\nPeople must find ways to justify their prejudiced attitudes. For example, following the shootings at Kent State, many attempted to portray the students as undeserving of help, describing them as dirty, oversexed, and lazy, thereby justifying the violence as a necessary outcome.

The statistics from SC do support the thesis, but not at the 90%, it is closer to about 75-80%. It is still a fact that if we kill someone it will most likely by someone we know simply because these are the people we are in contact with every day. In many cases the finger is not pulling the trigger, rather the trigger pulls the finger. Domestic disputes often en in tragedy, but only because one person doesn't think the other will actually shoot them, likewise the person with the gun really doesn't want to kill the other, only even the scales. But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced. Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger. If the gun had not been present, it may have ended in a fistfight, or simply in one of the brothers being upset.\nRacial prejudice still exists today, the only real difference is that it is not as open as it was in the sixties.

This is due to the fact that human beings tend to become frustrated with those whom they like and love. When we encounter a stranger, we generally do not care enough about him to allow frustration to develop. However, since frustration leads to aggression, and we normally become frustrated with those whom we like and love, human beings have a higher tendency for inflicting aggressive behavior on our loved ones.\nFifty years ago, when segregation was enacted, this led to stereotyping and prejudice. Because <*> were separated, this caused tremendous outgroup bias, leading to deep-rooted beliefs that black southern americans are inferior. Desegregation, shortly thereafter, raised prejudiced attitudes because of competition, and the fundamental attribution theory. <*> in classroom situations, for example, the white and black students lived in different social status, causing black students to feel intimidated about answering questions and speaking in class. The timidness of blacks in the classroom, caused other students to see these blacks as \"stupid\", thus, lowering the self esteem of the black student because of self-fulfilled prophecy. Low self-esteem only led to more shyness, and for the white students to further believe the stereotype: the black student is \"stupid\", because he does not speak in class.\nAlso, economic competition leads to prejudice, because the white men believed they were superior, even after desegregation. The problem lay with unequal status situation, where the whites could not relate to the blacks social situation. Racial prejudice has developed a trend for thirty years, as people continue to conform to prejudice, beliefs and attitudes.

This is because humans tend to become frustrated with those they know and love. When we encounter strangers, we generally do not have the same level of connection that can foster frustration. Since frustration often leads to aggression, and we are more likely to become frustrated with those we know and love, we have a higher tendency to inflict aggressive behavior on our loved ones.\n\nFifty years ago, when segregation was implemented, it led to stereotyping and prejudice. Because of the separation of races, it fostered outgroup bias, leading to deep-rooted beliefs that black southern Americans were inferior. Following desegregation, prejudiced attitudes increased due to competition and the fundamental attribution theory. For instance, in classroom situations, white and black students often lived in different social statuses, causing black students to feel intimidated about answering questions and speaking in class. This timidity caused other students to view these black students as \"stupid,\" which in turn lowered the self-esteem of the black students. This self-fulfilled prophecy only led to more shyness, and for white students to further believe the stereotype that black students are \"stupid\" because they do not participate in class.\n\nEconomic competition also contributes to prejudice, as white men often felt superior even after desegregation. The problem lay in the unequal status situation, where whites could not relate to the social situation of blacks. Over the past three decades, racial prejudice has developed as people continue to conform to prejudiced beliefs and attitudes. However, in situations like public housing where equal status exists, prejudice is greatly reduced. Hopefully, further implementation of programs to create more equal-status situations can help reduce prejudice in the South.", "speed": 0.45571562752107625, "eta": "00h04m43s"}

Today, the vast amount of UK families own a car. It is, no doubt, a fast way of commuting to and from destinations with little stress on the body, however traffic congestion is becoming a major concern in any city or town. It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it was before. Lancaster is a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.\nAlong with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared to give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common in the major American cities and even, at times, London.\nWith such are large no. of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. \u00a3 billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in as best a condition as possible.\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with he number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress which can again be due to traffic congestion.\nAll of these problems, one way or another, can all be linked with congestion and hence the number of cars on the road. To attempt to lessen this number, I have a number of solutions.\n1. Park and Ride - have cars outside of town and catch a free/cheap bus into town.\n2. Improvent of public transport - Cheaper fares, cleaner, more pleasant environment to encourage them to leave their cars at home.\n3.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The issues facing road transport are numerous and potentially severe, with traffic congestion being a major concern in any city or town.

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'. Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly. The M25 has already been dubbed 'the biggest car-park in Europe', and if current trends continue, the number of cars using it will double by 2030.\nA huge amount of pollution is chewed out by all those cars, contributing to global warming, acid rain and smog in cities. Although catalytic converters are now compulsory on new cars, fumes in cities have become so bad that scientists have linked them to a marked increase in the number of asthma sufferers. The emissions from diesel vehicles - cars, buses and lorries - are particularly harmful (just watch a bus start its engine, and observe the huge black cloud that belches forth from its exhaust pipe), and yet there is no control on these vehicles' exhaust.\nHundreds of people are killed on the roads every year, and as cars become faster and taffic denser, the number of accidents will surely increase. Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorries around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the road-haulage lobby on the government. Lorries create more noise and pollution than cars, and are much more damaging to the roads they travel on.\nNow that rail privatisation has gone ahead, many people are likely to lose faith in trains, due to the percieved inefficiency of the operators (for example the time-table book full of errors or the recent survey in Which? magazine about overcharging).

It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled.

Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads.

The essay will have four sections too it. Firstly the main problems of road transport will be identified and this shall be followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate. \nRoad transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room. Away from cities road construction faces the problem of geographical sites.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Before starting any essay, it is essential to define and understand the key words in the essay title. \"Main problems\" are those that concern road and rail transport operators significantly enough to deter them. The essay will be divided into four sections, first identifying the main problems of road transport and then proposing solutions. The same structure will be followed for rail transport, with arguments kept separate as their problems are largely distinct.\n\nRoad transport encompasses a wide range of vehicles, from bicycles to coaches, each carrying passengers to their destinations. The primary challenge of roads as a transport route is their capacity limit, resulting in increasing congestion on most British roads, whether motorways or \"A\" roads. Country lanes and small \"B\" roads are excluded from this discussion. \"Traffic jams\" are on the rise due to two main reasons: an ever-increasing number of vehicles on the road and poor planning of pre-existing road systems. One-way systems have been implemented in many cities, potentially making traffic flow easier today, had they been planned more effectively. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles attempt to use the same roads simultaneously, leading to heavy congestion on \"A\" roads into city centers during rush hours, typically between 7 AM to 9:30 AM and 4 PM to 6:30 PM. These roads are typically free at night. Motorways also face congestion at peak times during holiday seasons. \n\nThe second major challenge is the difficulty in constructing new roads. Increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are obstructing the construction of bypasses, such as the Dwyford Downs.

The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety. Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are numerous challenges facing both road and rail transport in the UK. Many of the most discussed issues concern road transport, particularly congestion and safety. Congestion is most evident in major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester, and Birmingham. A straightforward solution to alleviate this problem would be to either build more roads or expand existing ones. However, this approach has encountered significant opposition from environmental groups and local residents, as evidenced by recent controversies, such as the opposition to the Newbury road expansion plans.\n\nAnother method to reduce congestion, especially in large cities, could involve persuading people to refrain from using their vehicles altogether. Implementing schemes like the \u2018park-and-ride\u2019 scheme and promoting bicycle usage would certainly decrease the number of cars on the road.\n\nSafety is a key concern when it comes to roads. Too many accidents occur due to dangerous driving on busy roads. To address this, measures such as lowering the legal limit for alcohol while driving, increasing the number of police and speed cameras, and possibly imposing larger fines could be effective. Additionally, reducing the national speed limit might encourage drivers to be more cautious.\n\nWhile road safety is a critical issue, rail transport primarily faces challenges related to efficiency. A frequent complaint is that trains are often delayed and rarely run on time. Consequently, many rail customers are switching to other forms of transport, primarily cars, but also airplanes for longer journeys.\n\nThe inefficiency of rail transport is largely attributed to the outdated and slower trains. These trains are generally considered to be less efficient than modern models such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train. Improving the infrastructure and modernizing the rail system could significantly enhance efficiency and restore public trust in rail travel. Additionally, local councils play a crucial role in maintaining road conditions, especially during winter months, and may require more funding from the government to improve these conditions.", "speed": 0.45571562752107625, "eta": "00h04m43s"}

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception.

This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish, and can travel \"door-to-door\" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years, due to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.\nI think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport. The government should do this by investing more money into public transport than into road improvements, such as the widening of motorways. This increased investment would lead to more attractive public transport, with more services on the timetables, lower rates and less delays. These factors may make people convert from using their car to travel to work or school and to use busses or trains instead.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "If the rate of car ownership continues to increase at such a rapid pace, the roads will be completely congested.

These views are reinforced by high-profile cases like the James Bulger and Fred and Mary West cases, which have raised public awareness of safety concerns on the streets.\n\nConvenience is another reason people prefer cars, as they can travel at their own convenience and go directly from one place to another without the need to walk to bus stops or stations. The high levels of vehicles on the roads have also made cycling less acceptable for many people, due to the dangers and pollution from cars. In recent years, rail travel has seen a decrease in popularity due to the car's immense appeal and the perceived unreliability of train services. Unlike cars, trains are tied to timetables and station locations, offering less flexibility.\n\nTo address these issues, I believe the government should focus on reducing car usage and increasing the use of buses, trains, and other forms of public transport.

This led the times when at a general election when parties have come to power with less votes than the main opposition party. This was the case in 1970 with the Conservative victory under Edward Heath. Many would argue that the weaknesses and unfairness of this system are apparent and that it should be changed. However there are strengths to this system. The first past the post system always leads to strong government usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the conservatives in the early 1960's was done through the first past the post system; The other option is proportional representation which is seen to give more say to the electorate on who get elected. But unfortunatly this system can lead to weak government allowing the growth of political extremist parties, through the ability to have a member of Parliament even with the overall vote.

Many would argue that the weaknesses and unfairness of this system are apparent and that it should be changed.\n\nHowever, there are strengths to the first-past-the-post system. It always leads to strong government, usually leaving the governing party with a workable majority. Much of the work, to bring Britain into the modern economic world, done by the Conservatives in the early 1960s, was accomplished through this system. The alternative system, proportional representation, is seen to give more say to the electorate in who gets elected. However, this system can lead to weak government, allowing the growth of political extremist parties, through the ability to have a member of Parliament even with the overall vote. Additionally, weak government, especially within Britain's three-party system where the balance of power would always be held by the Liberal Democrats and the National Parties, can be a significant drawback.\n\nTherefore, while the first-past-the-post system has its strengths in ensuring strong government, it also has weaknesses that make it an outdated and sometimes unfair system.", "speed": 0.4519275664956322, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

It is, however, in my opinion, the best way for the basis of government. Consider a general election, in which three parties stand, X, Y, and Z, in a country of 5000 voters. Supposing 2000 people vote for party X and 1500 vote for parties Y and Z. Party X would come into power because they had the most votes. However there were 3000 people who did not want them to be in power, which is not the majority of the country. Also, the idea of each constituency having an MP who fights for that constituency's beliefs in parliament. This has major flaws. Consider, for example, the MP who recently decided she wanted to change parties. Yes, I know it is the MP's belief's the constituents are meant to vote on the ideas of that MP but this simply isn't the case in many circumstances, the voter votes on how that party for which that MP represents is doing at the moment. Once a party is in government it is free to do as it likes, changing it's policies, until the next general election, at which point it will make hollow promises about what it will do when it next gets in power, just to gain votes.\nIt is, as I said before, the best system. Consider dictatorships, this falls at the first hurdle. With this system any madman can control a country, having economic disasters for not only that country but other related countries.\nThere is no fair and perfect way to run a country. One please some people some of the time, but not all people all of the time. The only way a fair system of government can come about is in a group of about ten people at the most, and even then people are discontent.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The British parliamentary electoral system is often criticized for its perceived unfairness and lack of democratic principles.

Suppose 2000 people vote for party X, while 1500 each vote for parties Y and Z. Despite the majority of 3000 voters opposing party X, they would still see party X come into power based on having the most votes. This outcome highlights a significant flaw in the system: it does not necessarily reflect the will of the majority.\n\nThe concept of each constituency having an MP who represents the interests of that constituency within parliament is also problematic. For instance, consider the recent case of an MP who decided to switch parties. While it is true that constituents are meant to evaluate the MP\u2019s actions based on their beliefs, in many cases, voters base their decisions on the performance of the party the MP represents. Once a party is in power, it can change its policies freely, often promising future improvements at the next election, which are often empty promises designed to gain votes.\n\nIt is true that the system is not without its flaws, but it is still the best available. Unlike dictatorships, this system ensures that any single individual, no matter how extreme, cannot control a country and cause economic disasters. Moreover, no government system is perfectly fair and perfect, as each one has its own limitations and shortcomings. Even in a tightly controlled group of ten people, there will always be those who are dissatisfied.\n\nIn summary, while the current system has its imperfections, it offers a better balance of representation and accountability than other forms of government.", "speed": 0.4519275664956322, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Fox hunting is immoral and unnecessary. \nThe uniform of a fox hunter usually consists of a scarlet jacket, white 'jogpets', white shirt, black tie and polished black riding boots.

The dogs take the lead, once again there can be a number of anywhere between 20 and 100 dogs. The riders follow on. If we can possibly imagine what this poor fox is going through as it 'runs for its life' literally. If the fox happens to stray from the woodlands onto other farmers' property, across roads and fields - the dogs follow. This can cause immense damage to the countryside in the form of knocked-down walls, gates, trampled hedges and huge 'hoof' marks throughout the area.\nWhen the dogs finally catch up with the fox, it is literally ripped to pieces, limb from limb. The riders rarely actually get to see the fox, once it has been caught.\nHowever, on the other side of the argument the farmers say foxes are a pest and have to be controlled some way or another. The foxes kill sheep, hens and scare animals and so the farmers feel they have every right to kill these pests. The farmers also say the 'hunt' is very exciting and is a major part of their lives. The 'thrill of the chase' has no substitutes.\nNow that we have seen both sides to this argument solutions should be discussed. For example, foxes could be controlled in some other way, an example could be a shotgun. A bullet to the head is a much more  moral way to kill this animal than to literally rip it to shreads.

However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival.

Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats but now public opinion has put this to an end. \nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population.

In today's society it is an outdated and barbaric \"sport\" which, in my opinion, should be banned. \nIn this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare. Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals, which are going to be slaughtered, should be transported. These measures include the time the animals spend on the road, how much room they have etc. etc. However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs. This, apparantly, is a sport.\nThe Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes. Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government. It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators. At least if one dog fights another the fight is, in some, fair. But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others. The fox stands no chance, why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned.\nFox hunting is, for the most part, enjoyed by the upper-class. It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse, dogs and riding equipment (eg. helmet, boots etc.) you also need land to do it in. It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox-hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class, wealthy supporters who fox hunt.\nIn a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox. The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries (eg. when banning whaling) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals (eg. the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "An issue that is increasingly debated is whether fox hunting should be banned.

There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport. Numerous individuals are advocating for an end to the practice, and for good reason. Foxes are often killed or hunted for two main reasons: they prey on chickens, and some enjoy the social aspect of the sport. In the present day, farmers can certainly develop methods to prevent foxes from harming their chickens, thus eliminating the need for hunting and killing foxes. If such preventive measures are implemented, there would be no necessity for fox hunts, which would also reduce the harm caused to other wildlife.\n\nWhen hunts take place, numerous unintended consequences occur, including the destruction of animal habitats and the harm or killing of innocent animals. Once caught, foxes are said to suffer a cruel and terrifying death. Continued participation in such hunts is unjustifiable. Many people find no issue with foxes and argue that the sport should not be considered a pastime, as it fails to provide enjoyment for those engaging in it.\n\nFurthermore, if fewer foxes are killed, it would mean a smaller rabbit population, which would benefit many farmers and not be cruel. It is simply part of a different, more humane approach to managing the ecosystem. Fox hunting is a brutal sport, as foxes are pursued by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is chased until it is captured, and the prospect of this is deeply troubling. Most people would be relieved if fox hunting were banned.\n\nFoxes have the same right to exist on this earth as we do, and surely, there is a more humane way to manage their population. No one should be forced to undergo what a fox endures during a hunt. If foxes are unable to harm farm animals, there is no justification for banning the sport. Conversely, fox hunting should continue to maintain the balance in the food chain and avoid potential ecological imbalances. However, farmers can use alternative, non-harmful methods to control the rabbit population, such as using humane traps or poisons specifically designed to target rabbits without harming foxes. Banning fox hunting would not only deprive farmers of a necessary tool but also give activists a perceived victory, potentially encouraging them to focus on other issues.", "speed": 0.4519275664956322, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

The day that the Government starts to ban popular sports like boxing is the day I apply for American citizenship. The only argument of those who are for the banning of the sport is the fact that in the past few years there have been three incidents in Britain which have left one boxer dead and two others with brain damage. These men were professionals, they were not stupid. All boxers know the risks and are surrounded by people who are trained to look after them. Boxing is a high risk, short term career the men who do it are aware of this, that is why they are paid so highly. I recently read a report that stated that football players who play full back or centre forward in non-league football are more prone to long term head injuries than boxers because they often go without treatment and without taking precautions when they get concussed. This is cleer evidence that without the large sums of money envolved boxing would be far more dangerous because the medical care would be poorer. So, those that say the money pushes these boxers to their fates may be wrong in thinking so because it is the money which protects them in a way.\nHow could we ever ban a sport as full of skill and traditional values (such as good sportsmanship) as boxing is beyond me. Perhaps the fact that it is a sport which almost entirely excludes women counts against it. I can imagine how much feminists would dislike its machoism. But this is no reason to stop this ancient sport. I watched the Benn-McLellan fight in 1994 and despite the shocking consequences for McLellan it was one of the most memorable sporting occasions I have ever seen; The same can be said for Ali and Foreman's \"Rumble in the Jungle\" and I wonder if anyone who watched Frank Bruno win his world title fight this year will ever forget it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I am not a boxing fanatic, nor would I describe myself as an enthusiast.

However, these boxers were professionals who understood the risks. All boxers are well-aware of the dangers and are surrounded by medical professionals trained to mitigate those risks. Boxing is a high-risk, short-term career, and the men who choose to participate are compensated accordingly. A recent report revealed that football players, particularly those playing full back or centre forward in non-league football, are more prone to long-term head injuries due to inadequate treatment and lack of proper precautions. This suggests that without the financial incentives that boxing offers, the sport would be far more dangerous, as medical care would be subpar. Therefore, it is the money that provides the necessary protection, rather than pushing boxers to take unnecessary risks.\n\nHow could we ever ban a sport that is as full of skill and traditional values, including good sportsmanship, as boxing? Perhaps the fact that it almost entirely excludes women is a drawback, but this is no reason to eliminate this ancient sport. Boxing has produced memorable moments, such as the Benn-McLellan fight in 1994 and Muhammad Ali and George Foreman's \"Rumble in the Jungle.\" Even the recent victory by Frank Bruno in his world title fight is etched in my memory.

During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.\nThe brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.\nAnother aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.\nThe major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it. Boxing is one of the most popular sports, and it will be difficult to ban it.

The constant pounding of the head during a match doesn't necessarily do take it's toll immediately, but as a boxer's career continues, the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high. Is it right that we watch with excitement as someone is repeatedly battered about the head until they are no longer able to stand, could this not have an effect on our general attitude towards violence, children brought up to 'worship' idols such as Frank Bruno, as he pummuls someone into a hazy blur. Should boxing be banned. My answer to all of these questions is no. Maybe boxing is brutal, but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances. Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death. If boxing were banned where would we draw the line, skiing? mountaineering? diving? darts? I feel it is a human right to be allowed to face the risk of death, and a matter of personel opinion whether you watch it or no, boxing is usually on late at night, children only watch it if their parents allow them to.\nI think boxing should be encourage, in run down inner cities areas such as Moss Side, boxing is popular, it gives young lads a focus in life, it gives them a target. Many of the best boxers came from such areas, in my opinion they are better of boxing than stealing cars, taking drugs and shooting each other.\nBanning boxing is simply unnecessary, if it were banned then it would simply continue 'underground'. This would mean that boxing would become a much more dangerous sport as expert medical attention and proper match control wouldn't be ensured, the use of pads may also be ignored.\nThe only suitable action to be taken would be to increase safety regulations, ie. head guards and better gloves in all fights, or to shorten the length of fights to cut down some of the constant pounding.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing is often described as a barbaric sport, linked to deaths and brain damage among fighters.

One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health. \nAlso, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\nHowever, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing. Great precautions are taken to make boxing as safe a sport as possible, with several paramedics at ringside if they are needed.\nAlso, no-one is forcing boxers to fight. They have the decision as to whether or not they should participate in boxing match. Surely the choice should be theirs to make?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "One of the main arguments against boxing is the potential for severe brain injury due to the continual impact of punches. Each punch causes the brain to shift within the skull, from side to side, and finally stop as it strikes the inner wall of the temple. While a single hit is unlikely to result in immediate injury or death, repeated hits can lead to significant brain damage. The brain is normally protected by cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions and supports it. However, over time, this fluid can be gradually worn down, making the brain more vulnerable to damage.\n\nBoxers and fans argue that a typical fight lasts six 3-minute rounds and may result in only 100 head impacts during the 18-minute bout. A professional boxer might have about three fights a year, resulting in around 300 head impacts. However, this is not the entire picture. Sparring sessions, which can last many hours, often result in thousands of head impacts. This prolonged exposure to head trauma can seriously compromise a boxer's health.\n\nThere is also a moral issue to consider. Many people view boxing as a brutal sport that does not align with modern societal values. The primary goal of a boxer is to incapacitate their opponent, and they train rigorously to become formidable warriors. Despite these concerns, boxing has a relatively low mortality rate compared to other sports, such as horse riding or motor car racing. Extensive safety measures are in place to minimize risks, including the presence of paramedics at ringside.\n\nFurthermore, boxers are not coerced into fighting.

This century it's popularity has increased greatly, due on part to the personalities of such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.\nHowever there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in the ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of \"Prince\" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.\nThis apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport. When this behaviour is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.\nWhilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as other sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing has existed in its popular form for the last century and has significantly evolved since its early days of backstreet bare-knuckle fights.

However, there is a darker side to the sport that anti-boxing advocates often highlight. The recent death of Scottish welterweight Jim Murray in the ring in October has renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. This follows closely the tragic circumstances in which Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson were left, further tarnishing boxing's image. These events are contrasted starkly with the entertainment value of boxers like \"Prince\" Naseem Hussian and Chris Eubank.\n\nThe barbarianism of the sport is not helped by the behavior of certain boxers. For instance, Oliver McCall\u2019s pre-fight claims of revenge against Frank Bruno added fuel to the anti-boxing lobby's drive for banning the sport. This behavior, when combined with that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their bouts, raises serious concerns. While such behavior cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers, like other athletes, realize the risks associated with their professions.\n\nWhen considering the call for banning boxing, it is crucial to address what would happen if the sport were illegal. Almost certainly, if boxing were banned, it would go underground. This scenario would likely result in fewer safety measures, exacerbating the very risks that regulation aims to mitigate. An example of this can be drawn from motor racing. When Ayrton Senna died in the 1994 Imola crash, leading to discussions on new safety measures for racing cars, there were no calls for banning the sport. Instead, the focus was on improving safety to prevent future tragedies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the tragic aspects of boxing cannot be overlooked, the sport's underground nature would likely pose even greater risks to participants.

However, along with this development has come opposition from both the medical field and a proportion of the general public, who now would like to see the sport banned. \nFirstly, I would like to take the medical viewpoint. In the past not so much was know about damage caused to the brain by blows, but nowadays with advances in technology, this is more understood. The doctors are now able to see the damaging effects of repeated blows to the head, this has been supported recently by the deaths and serious mental injury suffered by well known boxers. Naturally, in their capacity of doctors they want to prevent injuries such as these occuring in the future and they feel the only way to be sure of this is to stop the sport altogether. As the sport has become more publicised, people hear more of injuries and fatalaties from around the world whereas before they only knew of a small number. Perhaps it is the fact that more is heard that there has been increased protestations from the public.

In the past, less was known about the damage caused to the brain by blows to the head. With advances in technology, doctors now better understand the harmful effects of repeated blows, supported by recent deaths and severe mental injuries among well-known boxers. Given their role as medical professionals, doctors prioritize preventing these kinds of injuries in the future and believe that the only way to ensure this is to eliminate the sport entirely. As boxing has gained more public attention, more people are becoming aware of the injuries and fatalities that occur, perhaps contributing to the heightened public protest. While it might seem like a minority of individuals strongly oppose the sport, their primary concern is the well-being of participants and their families, who often endure significant grief and trauma.\n\nNaturally, there are arguments for retaining boxing. The sport has become an incredibly lucrative enterprise, with millions of pounds offered to elite fighters, which benefits fight promoters and manager alike.

The arguament came to the fore again that boxing ought to be banned when Chris Eubank fought Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed and with brain damage. These two men were both professional fighters, the fact that Michael Watson has ended up how he is, is as much Michael Watson's fault for putting himself there as it is Chris Eubank's for doing it to him. However Michael Watson has never been able to forgive Chris Eubank, and many critics believe, that as sport is for enjoyment, no sporting event should end up with opponents not speaking to each other because it turns it into a war, which means a higher likelihood of someone being seriously hurt.\nAnother incident very similar to this was between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, and Gerald McClelland end up in a wheelchair. However months after this, McClelland friend Oliver McCall threatened to take revenge from McClelland on Frank Bruno.

Only recently though has it been debated so strongly. Over the past two years there has been many events which has marred boxing as a 'brutal sport'. In the Eubank-Watson fight, just over two years ago, Watson was left at the end of a great fight unconscious and fighting for his life. He had suffered a major blot clot in his brain and after serious surgery and over eight months I hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a serious speaking disorder. One young man's life smashed by just a twelve round fight. Nearly one year ago another man, McClellan, was also left in a critical condition after his fight with Eubank. He is still in hospital  to this day, recovering. The most recent incident which has fuelled the debate has been the death of the young Scotsman - James Murray. After suffering a brain haemorage during his World Championship defence, he was left in a coma with serious brain damage. He died later the next day. These three events are only a fraction of the incidents occuring in a boxing ring which have caused controversy over the sport.\nA boxer's risks do not stop when he retires. Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in the sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain. This damage has built up every fight and the boxer is ore likely, even though he doesn't perticipitate in the sport any more, to have a brain haemorrage or a stroke. They are also very likely to suffer, in their old age, from a serious and sometimes fatal disease called Parkinson's disease. It affects the nervous system very badly and can lead, in some cases, to paralysation. Is this kind of a risk really worth a life in the sport of boxing?\nThere are, however, many reasons why the sport of boxing should not be banned. A large percentage of teenage children or young adults will have heard of the events involving Watson, McClellan and Murray. If they didn't read it then they'll, no doubt, have heard it on the news or from friends.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The case for banning boxing as a sport has been debated for several years, but recently, it has become a particularly contentious issue.

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery was once criticized as \"a tax on the stupid,\" a phrase with dual meanings. Firstly, it was a critique aimed at the government for raising additional revenue without introducing a new tax. The government was aware of the public's strong aversion to taxation and, therefore, the objection to the lottery focused on its marketing as a game rather than a tax. The government was not only criticized for collecting any money from the lottery but also for its share, which was seen as diverting funds meant for \"good causes.\" Secondly, the criticism addressed the marketing strategies employed by the lottery, particularly the emphasis on the likelihood of winning despite the low statistical chances. The slogan \"it could be you\" faced intense scrutiny.\n\nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of lottery players spend amounts they can afford based on their income, dispelling the notion that the public would spend beyond their means due to the lottery's allure. In fact, these studies indicate that spending on the lottery correlates with income; the poor spend the least, while the rich spend the most. This suggests that, contrary to critics' assertions, there are not as many \"stupid\" people in Britain as those who opposed the national lottery initially believed.\n\nRegarding the government's role, there was no attempt to conceal that the government would benefit financially. Other forms of gambling and most spending are already taxed, and it would be unreasonable to expect the government to exclude the lottery from taxation. \n\nAdditionally, the lottery was criticized for misrepresenting the allocation of its funds, especially with regard to \"good causes\" and charities. Critics argued that the emphasis on the amounts going to these causes was overhyped, suggesting that charities would suffer from the lottery's introduction. However, the reality is that the allocation of funds is transparent, and the government's tax revenue is just one part of the overall distribution.", "speed": 0.4519275664956322, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA) the lottery was most popular with people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty. Stuck in the poverty trap, where any wages are offset by the twas in benifits,  it was predicted that people would spend money they couldn't afford on a gamble they had no chance in winning. Early research centred on inner city areas with high unemployment indicates that on average, regular participants of the Lottery spend about \u00a310 a week.\nMany critics of the Lottery felt that because a proportion of the profits were going to be given to good causes, people would  be 'conned' into playing the Lottery because they would think they had been giving money to charity. It is now known that only eight pence in the pound has been given to good causes, and this has also resulted in another of the warnings being proved correct; that donations to legitimate charities has significanlly fallen since the introcution of the Lottery.\nOpposition to the lottery by betting shops was disregarded by many but the popularity of other forms of gambling have also fallen since the Lottery's introduction. This has resulted in many betting shops having to close down, resulting in unemployment. The fear of a nation of gamblers was one which caused many people to be opposed to the lottery, and its massive popularity seems to indicate to this. Especially considering that traditional non-gamblers are gambling on a bet where the odds are 14 million to one.\nPrior to the Lottery's implementation, no one knew where all these profits were going to go. It is now clear that the majority has gone straight into Camelot's pockets, and if the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering Virgin were prepared to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise, and giving all the profits to the government.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "One of the biggest arguments against the introduction of the Lottery was that it would effectively become a \"poor person's tax.\" Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA), the lottery was most popular among people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty.

The vast majority saw the idea as an exciting one and were interested in taking part in such a large-scale competition where such huge amounts of money were at stake. However, some people saw the lottery as a bad thing which would tend to become a hopeless addiction. These people tended to be those whose ideas and actions the general public are expected to follow; such as church leaders, or members of Parliament.\nThe arguments which these people suggested were numerous. Firstly, the amount of money which the jackpot winners were likely to receive was deemed as 'too much' or even 'unseemly'. The objectors felt that such a large amount of money (up to \u00a39 million on any normal lottery draw) was too much to be given to just one party. The recent 'double rollover' jackpot fund gave a figure of \u00a342 million which, theoretically, could have gone to just one lucky winner. This was deemed by the Bishop of Durham as 'an obscene amount of money', and many other members of the religious fraternity agreed and made their thoughts on the matter public.\nSecondly, many people believe that the amount of the cost of each ticket which goes to various charities is far too little. At present this stands at 5%. People feel that this amount is not enough, especially as one of the main reasons for the introduction of a British national lottery was the issue of raising funds for home charities and needy causes.\nThis issue is coupled with the profit margin which the lottery organisers, Camelot, obtain.

The vast majority viewed the idea as exciting and were enthusiastic about participating in a large-scale competition where substantial amounts of money were at stake. However, some believed the lottery would lead to addiction and other negative outcomes. These critics were often influential figures, such as church leaders and members of Parliament.\n\nThe arguments against the lottery were diverse. One primary concern was the amount of money in the jackpot. Critics deemed it excessive, with some even describing it as \"unseemly.\" For instance, the Bishop of Durham referred to the potential jackpot of up to \u00a39 million as \"an obscene amount of money,\" a sentiment echoed by many within the religious community. Additionally, the recent 'double rollover' jackpot, which reached \u00a342 million, reinforced these concerns.\n\nAnother argument was that the amount of money allocated to charities through lottery tickets was too small. Currently, this stands at 5% of each ticket's cost. Critics felt that this percentage was insufficient, especially considering the lottery's initial goal was to raise funds for home charities and other needy causes. Moreover, the profit margin for the organizers, Camelot, was seen as excessively high. Many felt that if some of Camelot's profits were redirected to the charity fund, the overall fairness of the lottery would be significantly improved.", "speed": 0.4519275664956322, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points.

The National Lottery is a mass-produced, user-friendly form of gambling with extremely high stakes, encouraged by the government. It has been dubbed \"the tax for the poor\" because inevitably, the people with the least will want to win the most and waste money they cannot afford to.\n\nThere are many groups campaigning against the lottery, with the most prominent being the churches and many charity organizations. The churches argue that the lottery is causing misery to thousands of people, with some becoming addicted and spending everything they own on it, while others do not have enough money to feed themselves even before wasting it on odds of millions to one, which any regular gambler knows are not worth a second look. The churches and charities also argue that they are losing money which they desperately need to help millions of people worldwide, while the one person who receives millions each week benefits. The lottery does give a very small proportion of its earnings to charity; however, an international charity which saves millions of people each year would get less money than a school that wants a new sports hall.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the National Lottery remains incredibly popular. The political party that would remove it would likely be the most unpopular to date.", "speed": 0.4498665743607864, "eta": "00h02m24s"}

These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and other more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would have been donated to charity.\nAnother objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more on the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young people (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people. \nFinally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as \u00a340 million.

There are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society. One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry. Since the early 1980's, when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people, controversy has followed about their effect on children. There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child's ability to learn. The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the \"problem\". The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children. However, parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn. Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer, the calculator, to help them.\n\tAnother moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace. There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace. The role of computers is already significant in employment areas, such as accountancy, which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers.

Such developments have both made the human brain more dependent upon the computer as its increased usage has made various parts of the brain lazy. On the other hand the discoveries made by computers have stimulated the human brain to further fields of thought. However, which has a greater effect on us and why depends much on our circumstances.\n\tIn the world today children are taught about things which have only come to light as a result of the technological revolution, namely the computer. For example the nature of the sun's surface has been made available by computer technology. This provides simple additional information not requiring the brain to think much, unless one is able to think around it such as in companion to other planet's surfaces. Therefore, the human brain whilst dependent upon its data from the computer is able to establish more lines of thought and expand its capacity. However it is also important that children do not become overreliant upon computers from an early age as they will not have the chance to develop their own brain in doing subjects, such as mathematics. However as more and more children become acquainted with computers their brain becomes lazier in carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Therefore, the child must be taught to be independent before being introduced to computers by which it may expand its knowledge and understanding.\n\tIndeed computers are simply the result of what humans know and thus have instructed the computer to do. They are man-made and thus have been established by our own brain power, and so have been programmed with a similar line of thought. This argument could point to computers as the replacement of human brains yet their development is similar to ours, as we programme them according to the knowledge which we acquire. Therefore, the human brain should be able to understand a computer's programme and line of thought as being similar to its own. This point of view displays the computer as a substitute for a human brain which, once skilled in its use, is a major problem in its use by many people.\n\tHowever to those in complex fields such as physics the computer has been able to stimulate the human brain on to further research.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The invention of the computer has facilitated the role of the human brain in many areas such as spelling, mathematics, physics, and geography.

The balance between these effects largely depends on our circumstances.\n\nIn today's world, children are taught about technologies like computers, which have brought to light new information such as the nature of the sun's surface. This information provides simple additional data, requiring little thought unless one uses it to compare and contrast with data on other planets. Thus, the human brain, while becoming dependent on computer data, can still establish more lines of thought and expand its capacity. However, it is crucial that children do not become overly reliant on computers from an early age, as this can hinder the development of their own brain and problem-solving skills, such as in mathematics. As more children are introduced to computers, their brain's capacity to perform even the simplest tasks can diminish. Therefore, children must be taught to be independent before being introduced to computers to ensure their brain's ability to expand its knowledge and understanding is not compromised.\n\nComputers are simply the result of human knowledge and the commands we give them.

These are just the musings of those who have little to do with computers and who do not realize that behind every computer is a programmer. Even AI needs to be programmed. It is human brains that work out how to build computers, program them, and, more importantly, control them.\n\nAs for making the human brain redundant, computers can actually help to improve learning skills. They can teach, test, and enhance our linguistic abilities. Reflexes are improved (and this has been scientifically proven) by playing computer games, the very same activities that parents often claim turn their children into \"zombies.\" We can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer-simulated models, enabling us to design buildings and road networks.\n\nIn conclusion, the computer revolution has not made our brains redundant. Instead, it has opened up new areas of our minds that we never knew existed!", "speed": 0.4498665743607864, "eta": "00h02m24s"}

While \"Western\" developed countries have begun popularising the computer, developing countries have very much been left in the dark as their education levels and culture do not allow for mass computer demand.\n\tThe invention of the computer meant that industry could benefit from the further technological inventions that followed. Robotic production of cars, for example, allowed many firms to increase their efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, the advent of computer usage in the home could be argued to increase educational levels. As supply in computers through changing technology arrived, so demand was to gradually increase in the long term, both for the individual and for the firm. This long term change in demand can be charted to see if it has lead to a drastic fall in the usage of the human brain.\n\tAs I have said, changing technology has allowed factories to use robots for production. It has also created the internet, a global forum linking every part of the world up so that information can be passed on more easily. Similarly, the computer has also brought society video games, in the form of companies such as Sega and Nintendo. We must ask if such video games are detrimental to the youth of the world and also its population, or whether they relieve stress and form part of modern life. They do utilise the brain, testing reaction times and lateral thinking skill, but is this escapism a good or a bad thing? There is certainly a change in attitudes in society.\n\tSecondly, educational levels in the developed world have also changed drastically wih the technological revolution of the computer. On the one hand, clearly this has lead to a decrease in primary and secondary labour sectors. That is, in agriculture and more importantly in manufacturing. Robots replace people and computers mean that only one supervisor - or head of technology - is needed on a factory production line.\n\tYet amongst the job losses through this, in the UK students in sixth form wishing to go on to university are nearing the highest level they've ever been. Computerised administration systems aid this, and while at university computers are used heavily in all subjects as an educational aid.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In analyzing how far the invention of the computer has made the human brain redundant, we must remember that changes in the demand for computers have not been universal.

Concurrently, the rise of computer usage in homes has potentially enhanced educational levels, as the increasing supply of computers through evolving technology has gradually increased demand.

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products.

It has been discovered that the disease can be transmitted to humans due to consumption of the infected beef.\nBeef production is a fairly large business in the U.K and it was necessary to discover more about this relatively new disease.\nIt was discovered that British farmers were to blame, due to their various industrial techniques. The disease originally, was carried by chickens. When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat, the remains (bone and organs) were processed to provide a cheep feeding product. Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well. The cows contracted the disease (in a slightly different form) and this was when \"BSE\" first came about.\nThe correct thing to do, would have been to destroy the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation. However, the farmers had money involved and did not. When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef, their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further.\nUnfortunately, unlike the chickens, the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans in their beef.\nThe same industrial techniques are still used today, and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health concious, the sales in beef have decreased.\nIt is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years. And so, some attitudes of the public are: \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\". Another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims. But it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely.\nIt seems that more and more families have opted for chicken, pork or lamb as an alternative.\nIt could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well. If there is a point where supply outweighs demand, farmers will produce less beef and make less money. It is therefore, conceivable to think that farmers will change from beef to an alternative product.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The main problem in the United Kingdom is BSE, or as it is commonly known, \"Mad Cow Disease.\" This disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of infected beef. Beef production is a significant business in the U.K., necessitating a deeper understanding of this relatively new disease. It was discovered that British farmers were to blame due to their industrial practices. The disease initially was carried by chickens. When farmers killed the chickens for their meat, the remains (including bones and organs) were processed to create a cheaper feeding product. Unfortunately, these infected organs were not only fed back to chickens but to cows as well, leading to the development of BSE in cattle.\n\nThe correct course of action would have been to destroy the infected cows, ending the potential life-threatening situation. However, due to financial interests, the farmers did not implement this solution. When these infected cows were slaughtered for beef, their remains were processed and reintroduced to other cattle, further spreading the disease. Unlike chickens, cattle could pass BSE to humans through their meat.\n\nThe same industrial techniques are still employed today. With increasing health consciousness among the UK public, beef sales have decreased. It can take up to seven years to learn if one has contracted BSE, leading to various public attitudes. Some people believe, \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\" Others ignore warnings due to the lack of known victims. However, the most common approach is to avoid beef altogether for safety reasons.\n\nAs a result, more families are opting for chicken, pork, or lamb as alternatives. This shift could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry. If supply outweighs demand, farmers will reduce beef production and earnings. It is therefore reasonable to expect that farmers might switch to alternative products to sustain their income.", "speed": 0.4498665743607864, "eta": "00h02m24s"}

This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.\nThe reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.\nIf these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers this would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and know nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.\nI personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government. The government wants to be self-sufficient, and also keep unemployment as low as possible, so the government will start to buy up surpluses. <figure> In this situation, at price P, more is supplied, than demanded, but this intervention price means that the farmers can produce what they like, as they get to sell their surplus anyway.\nAll this will do for the agricultural industry is ensure farmers can predict their income for the next year. This is because once these \"price-support schemes\" are started, they are very difficult to take down again.\nIn conclusion, although this is a dangerous disease that may be contractable, the agricultural industry will not fall by as greater degree as anticipated.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Recently, the consumption of beef in the UK has fallen dramatically.

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) involves the fertilisation of an egg in a laboratory, typically in a test tube. The egg is retrieved from the mother and placed in an environment designed to optimise fertilisation by the father's sperm. Once fertilisation occurs, the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mother's womb, where the pregnancy proceeds normally. Typically, more than one egg is retrieved to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and to allow for potential future use. This approach often results in multiple births, such as twins or triplets.\n\nThere are those who oppose IVF, arguing that it is unnatural and question the fairness of starting life in a test tube, believing that life begins at the moment of conception. Ethical considerations also arise regarding who should be eligible for the treatment and at what age it should no longer be available. Some argue that spending substantial amounts of money on IVF when the same funds could save hundreds of lives by vaccinating people against measles is not justified. Those in favour of IVF can argue that it is a fundamental right for every person to have their own child. Women who might otherwise be unable to conceive, due to conditions such as blocked fallopian tubes, can now have children with the help of IVF, which is only fair.\n\nTechnology has advanced rapidly, yet ethical guidelines and practical regulations have not kept pace. Therefore, it is essential to establish certain regulations. For instance, fertility treatment should not be provided to post-menopausal women, as their bodies are no longer capable of bearing children. Last year, a case involving a post-menopausal woman who had lied about her age to obtain IVF highlights the need for stricter regulations.", "speed": 0.4498665743607864, "eta": "00h02m24s"}

The desire to have children is so great mothers can pay thousands of pounds in the hope they may concieve. I find this to be a difficult issue to agree or oppose as only being young and having my life ahead it is quite easy to say that it is disgraceful women of late 50's having children and they had their chance and they let it go but if at fifty and maybe you put your career first all your life and now want a family should you not be given the chance and is it not how old you are but what kind of a mother you would be? I think that I would like to see a change in the law to allow women to have children if they feel able to cope but I feel if legalised it would be a decision taken to freely by women and not taking into consideration the consequences. At twelve years old the mother could be near seventy and is this really the age to bring up a teenager? The resentment, bullying and communication barrier between the child and mother could cause numerous problems. I think if legalised and offered to women it would need some kind of councilling and assessment as each case is individual.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the process of fertilising an egg outside the mother's body in a laboratory environment. The sperm and egg from both partners are combined in a test tube, hence the term \"test tube baby.\" As of the current legal status, IVF is permissible in the UK, and the world\u2019s first IVF baby was born in 1978. The moral debate surrounding IVF revolves around whether it is ethically acceptable to begin a child\u2019s life in a test tube rather than inside the mother, and whether this method might have any detrimental effects on the child. There is also the concern that society might become overly reliant on IVF for fertility treatments.\n\nFertility treatment for post-menopausal women presents another ethical dilemma. While menopause is often considered the natural end to a woman\u2019s ability to bear children, the medical advances of recent years have enabled women to have healthy children later in life. Despite some opposition from British doctors, such treatments are widely available abroad, driven by the strong desire of mothers to conceive. However, the high cost of these treatments, potentially thousands of pounds, underscores the intense wish to have children.\n\nThis issue is challenging to address. At a young age, it is relatively easy to dismiss post-menopausal mothers who wish to have children, arguing that they had their chance and let it go. However, for a woman who prioritised her career and is now ready to have a family, the desire to be a mother should not be dismissed. The key question is not age but the potential quality of motherhood.\n\nI believe that the law should be changed to allow women to have the option of IVF if they feel capable of raising a child. Nevertheless, I also worry that such a decision could be made without fully considering the potential consequences. A woman of 12 years old bringing up a teenager at nearly 70 raises significant questions about the appropriate age to parent. The potential for resentment, bullying, and communication barriers could lead to numerous problems.\n\nIf IVF were to be legalised and offered to women, it should be accompanied by counseling and individual assessments. This is crucial to ensure that the decision to undergo IVF is well-informed and that the mother is prepared for the responsibilities and challenges that come with it.", "speed": 0.4498665743607864, "eta": "00h02m24s"}

Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed. People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants, there are many complications but many are succesful. People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.\n\tBodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Science has made significant strides since the 19th century.

IVF has been around for over a decade and still is the centre of difficulties and conflicts. IVF pushes all parties involved with to the limit, morally, legally and ethically.\n\tThe first argument is that of the parents. These people can be like anyother healthy, successful etc. but infertile. Should they have the right to 'buy' themselves a baby? I think so. If they can afford the treatment and deal with the issues surrounding it, then they should go ahead. A child will make them happy and feel complete as a family and everyone has the right to feel that. Those with less money, however either have to not bother, take years saving up or adopt - but this is not the same as having your own biological baby.\n\tProblems which may arise for the parents are mainly the chances of the treatment being unsuccessful. This can be a major disappointment especially if the couple have spent all their savings on the treatment. They could even get into debt if they wanted to try again. There is the ethical issue if on finding out if the baby will be deformed or mentally ill in anyway whether to abort the foetus or not.\n\tFertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of the most controversial issues when discussing IVF. They have their own personal reasons for why they want a baby at that stage of life. Most people disagree with it from the start without even hearing the argument from the mother. This is because they probably see it as unnatural to continue (or <?> having children when the body is not biologically prepared for it. Personally, I think that this is only acceptable when the woman has married or wants to start a family with a younger partner. This is where the rights of the child comes in.\n\tIf the parents are still relitavely young, then the child will in most cases have a reasonable quality of life. If a post menopausal woman has a child then in a very high majority of cases she will be at least 45-50 years of age and will be an O.A.P.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of many treatments associated with complex medical ethics.

However, those with less financial means often have to either forgo the treatment, save for years, or adopt, which is not the same as having a biological child.\n\nAnother significant issue arises from the potential for IVF treatments to be unsuccessful. Parents who have spent their savings on the treatment may face major disappointment and, in extreme cases, debt if they wish to try again. Additionally, ethical dilemmas can arise if parents are informed that the foetus might be deformed or mentally ill. The decision to terminate the pregnancy in such cases is a complex ethical issue.\n\nA particularly controversial aspect of IVF is the use of fertility treatment in post-menopausal women.

For instance, fertility treatment for post-menopausal women should be strictly regulated. Unless there is a reasonable argument, such as early menopause, there should be age limitations. For example, a woman going through IVF treatment at 55 years old and conceiving would face significant challenges. By the time the child reaches its teens, the mother would be nearly 70 years old, which could impact the child's quality of life.

However, it is crucial to consider the quality of life the child would face.\n\nIn the earlier days of IVF, multiple births were more common, with cases of women giving birth to seven babies rather than just one.

In vitro ie. in a natural environment.\nThis gives couples who could not naturally have children the ability to have their own family without adopting.\na) Fertility treatment for post-menopausal women enables parents to start a family later in life. This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged to have children for her partner. Having a child is stressful at any age but if the mother is older when the child very young she may not have the energy to get up four times every night etc.\n\tTherefore, although I agree with fertility treatment for post menopausal women I think that upper age limits should be applied. Also, I think the women should have a form of councelling before hand so that they are aware of how much more stressful it is to bring up children later in life.\nb) Sex Selection.\n\tThis form of genetic engineering allows the parents to choose their own child. Therefore, couples who only want boys could do so. However, if a couple could only love one gender of child should they have one? Although in principle the idea of choosing children is not a bad one, where would it stop? If this is acceptable then choosing blonde hair and blue eyes may also become acceptable. This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the parents may find it hard to love the child.

As the general populace increasingly believes in the infallibility of science, it is crucial that scientists act as the first line of defense against the misuse of their discoveries. While it can be argued that scientists only make discoveries and it is others who misuse them, for example Marie Curie could not have foreseen the nuclear threat of the Cold War as she worked with radioactive samples, scientists still bear the responsibility to ensure the ethical and responsible use of their findings.", "speed": 0.4602738358814247, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This technique has been of great benefit to the human race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.\n\tIt is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides. This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for any later events.\n\tToday, much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work on this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.\n\tWhere scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes. These are now available in a supermarket near you, with their genes altered to increase their redness, juiciness or resistance to disease. These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe, but if they, or some other genically engineered food, proves to cause a terrible disease, than that is the fault of the scientist who developed them, because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side-effects, that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market, and the scientists are to blame.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Genetic manipulation has been ongoing for centuries through selective breeding, both of crops and animals.

Genetic Engineering is however a very raw issue and there is a lot of resistance to this work and certainly the suggestions of using it on humans. The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, and indeed he may, there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. And indeed this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered. But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon.\n\tWe can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject. But are we right to blame him? Let us consider that he has discovered a cure for cancer as a result of genetic engineering. It is against human nature to stop at this stage and ask, should I introduce what could be the greatest medical discovery of our lifetime when I am not 100% sure of the consequences. Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world? In truth no, it is unreasonable.\n\tGenetic engineering is developing rapidly and already has been used extensively in plants and bacteria notably for the production of resistant strains of plants and in the production of human insulin. The natural step forward now is to apply this knowledge to treat common genetic disorders like Down's Syndrome. There is a lot of resistance to this and fears that we may manufacture mutants or that somebody may produce an army of superhuman clones. Some of these may seem a little far fetched but it is conceivable that in a 100 years time we may be able to decide the characteristics of our child, whether he is a great piano player or sportsman.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists around the world are investigating genetic manipulation for a wide variety of beneficial causes.

Scientists in general don't wish to take over the world. They are generally manipulated by politicians who do. However scientists should have an ethical code that they should stick to.

Alternatively, if they change their experiment only slightly, a completely new killer strain of the plant could be found. However, the scientist would not have known which outcome they would achieve before or even during the experiment. In general, it is politicians and leaders who misuse the power bestowed upon them and destroy the good work of scientists. Biological warfare is not the scientist\u2019s fault; he did not use it to kill. In fact, it was probably an experiment with herbicides that went wrong. The image of the mad scientist over bumbling pots is just fiction. Scientists, in general, do not wish to take over the world; they are often manipulated by politicians who do.\n\nHowever, scientists should have an ethical code that they should stick to. For instance, experimentation upon live animals, especially humans, should not be undertaken. An example of this was the Nazi's in World War 2 experimenting on the Jews by trying to genetically alter them. This, of course, ended in failure. There have been other cases of such atrocities committed by scientists since then as well. These people have always been shunned by the scientific community.\n\nOn the other hand, most scientists don't get the credit they deserve for their inventions. For instance, many millions will be made by the genetic engineering of crops, yet the scientists would never get any money or very little credit for it. Only the most careful scientists who get the copyright before the idea is released will get any credit, but these people are often shunned as being too overprotective and are even called heretics.\n\nIn general, scientists should have a moral responsibility to act like normal human beings. However, they should not be blamed for any misuse of their final invention if they do not receive any credit for it. Nevertheless, if the scientist does get copyright and then sells it to the highest bidder, he must also think about the greater good.", "speed": 0.4602738358814247, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This renaisance period was an opportunity for Da Vinci and others to begin to understand the makings of the World around them, in a more logical and ordered way. In a way Da Vinci is a bad example, as he was not a scientist like you might find today, he was driven by many different things, art, mechanics etc. The difference was that in Da Vinci's day and in Faradays' the was so much unknown that any slight discovery would warrant investigation and the formulation of some rule or other.\n\tModern Scientists have much more information, and a greater technology to work that information into better use. Also there are far more scientists who can do this aswell. Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct an indepth study of a single subject and find out all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday there is less need to take everything as unknown and new. Scientists today are more concerned with advancing their knowledge, and I consider this a good thing, because how else would technology be updated. However this is not to say that I feel Scientists don't have or shouldn't have a certain curiosity about the unknown, or work is a wider field, but the fact that there are far more men discovering far less to uncover, suggests that some specialisation is the next logical step.\n\tAs far as schools and colleges are concerned I think it is very important to study as wide a field as is possible, because concentrating soley on one science closes so many other doors of discovery. Not to mention the fact that the sciences aid each other in understanding more easily and predicting the outcome.\n\tFor this reason I think combined courses are a very good thing. Not only do they create more of interest in science, in a more rounded sense, but also lay a firmer foundation for specialising at a later date.\n\tA combined course such as Biology and Chemistry opens doors to the likes of Biochemistry, genetic engineering and other professions which rely on a more informed background of science.

While Da Vinci is often seen as a prime example, he was not a scientist in the modern sense; he was driven by many interests, including art and mechanics. The difference in his time and in that of Faraday was that much of the world was unknown, making even minor discoveries significant and prompting further investigations and rule formulation.\n\nIn contrast, modern scientists have much more information and advanced technology to work with. Additionally, there are far more scientists conducting research today. Therefore, it is more beneficial to conduct an in-depth study of a single subject, discovering all there is to know, rather than pursuing a brief interest in everything. With far more having been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday, there is less need to treat everything as unknown and new. Today\u2019s scientists are more focused on advancing their knowledge, which I consider a positive development, as it drives technological progress. However, this does not mean that scientists lack or should not have a curiosity about the unknown or a broader field of work. The fact that there are many more scientists uncovering less unknown territory suggests that some specialization is the next logical step.\n\nWhen it comes to schools and colleges, it is crucial to study as wide a field as possible. Concentrating solely on one science limits the potential for discovering new knowledge in other areas. Moreover, the sciences often aid each other in understanding complex topics more easily and predicting outcomes. For this reason, I believe that combined courses are a very good idea. Not only do they enhance students' interest in science in a more comprehensive sense, but they also lay a strong foundation for future specialization.\n\nFor instance, a combined course in biology and chemistry opens doors to the fields of biochemistry, genetic engineering, and other professions requiring a more informed scientific background.

This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today.

As technology advances, humans become increasingly reliant on computers. The remarkable ability of computers to process information and present it in a manner that we can understand gives them a significant edge over the human brain.\n\nHowever, there are certain tasks that computers cannot handle. Unlike humans, computers are not capable of independent thought and can only perform what they are programmed to do. This limitation can pose significant challenges. For instance, even the smallest error in the programming can cause the computer to execute the wrong instructions, as it cannot recognize that there is an error. If a human were in the same situation, they would be more likely to detect the error and produce a better-quality end product. Although this human approach would take longer, the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome is higher compared to a computer\u2019s output.

This is not only shown in the input of data but also in the design and manufacture of computers themselves: it was human ingenuity that led to its invention. Although the computers are able to measure events more effectively than the human brain computers are a tool. This is especially shown in the scientific world where increasingly efficient measuring tools have made events possible and known to mankind but they only work when a human realises there is something they can be applied to. This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom. This has reduced the need for human skills and tradition specialist occupations. This is seen by lathe operators, computer are able to produce each good exactly the same as the previous one.

This can only lead to advancement of both society and the individual, all brains are encouraged, and indeed it is necessary, to learn more.

Meat production is one of the most inefficient energy conversion processes known to man. The conversion of the sun's energy into meat is only 1/10 as efficient, as eating the plants directly. Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef. Adaptions in food technology however have made for much more efficiency in the conversion of energy by this process, such as battery rearing and hot house (i.e. in door) cows. Cruelty to animals has never really stopped people from eating meat, as there is little relationship in general in the public's minds as to how the piece of meat with their meal equates to a living being.\nPeople eat meat due to finding it tastier than a plateful of vegetables. Humans are omnivores and always have been. So what could possibly stop them from eating beef? The answer is fear for their lives. One of the new technological improvements to boost the efficiency of crop to wheat by the agricultural industry was to take all of the undesirable bits of sheep and other animals, such as gristle and bone and boil them up to produce offal.

For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.\nIf people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead?

Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 %.\nAlthough scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef. customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some 'dodgy' butcher trying to cut costs.

An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant.

And furthermore the fall that Britain isn't importing beef means that other countrys would'nt want to import UK beef because there is no tradeing between the countrys. This would also mean the change from Beef farming to crops or pig farming which would mean the clustering of all the cows and then wastage of this meat. The industry would also require heavy government subsidys to start the industry running again and for the diversifying by previous beef farmers.
