This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith.

At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later.

On studying France throughout the twentieth century we can see that this is indeed true.\nIf we start at the beginning of the century we see that the growth of the population was inhibited greatly by the first world war, where France suffered many losses. The fact that the men in the society left to fight meant that the number of births was reduced greatly. This was also the case on the return of the men, when many did not come back having been killed. Therefore after the first world war the population of France decreased greatly.\nImmigration was already present at this time, and helped to make up for the large number of losses in the war. Slowly the population began to build itself up again until the beginning of the Second World War. In this war France did not suffer as many casualties and deaths as in the first world war, but the fact that there had already been losses made the situation grave for France. The economy needed rebuilding, as did the whole country, and the work force was very depleated. There was an urgent call for immigrant workers to come to France, and indeed they did come (about 4 million).\nWhen the troops came home, and families were reunited there was a great increase in births. The previous Malthusian attitude that less children meant a better life and greater security was replaced by a new attitude that in order to create and rebuild France a strong workforce was needed. Having a child was regarded as an 'investment in the future'. The french realised that a defeat was due to the fact that they were not a strong nation, and they wanted to build such a nation.\nThe gouvernement also adopted various policies to try and increase births in the society. It was suggested in the 1920s that contraception should be made illegal, but in the end this was restricted.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament.

De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent centrings made it clear that a clearly visible president was required, who would be the 'keystone' to the parliamentary r\u00e9gime. The constitution of 1958 honoured this, by placing the President first among the members of parliament.\nThere is however a fundamental difference between the powers that the constitution and those who drafted it gave the President and the powers that he subsequently acquired. The result is a very interesting example of how circumstances and personality can change the constitution.\nThe constitution had originally left policy and decision making to the prime minister and his government (articles 20-23). The power granted under article twelve to dissolve parliament would, according to Michel Debr\u00e9, only allow a short exchange with the public. According to the constitution, the President was only to assume the role of constitutional dictator in times of grave trouble (art. 16). In a brilliant exegis of the constitution he had authored in large part, Michel Debr\u00e9 said that the role of the President was to be that of an arbiter, to oversee the constitution, and be 'beyond politics and the political parties. \nThis seems to have been somewhat unrealistic. Neither the war in Algeria, nor, despite appearances the personality of de Gaulle would let him be the arbiter of the constitution. \nThe referendum in 1962 gave the President the legitimacy of the public vote.

De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent actions made it clear that a visibly prominent president was required, who would be the \"keystone\" to the parliamentary regime. The 1958 constitution honored this by placing the President above other members of parliament.\n\nHowever, there is a fundamental difference between the powers the constitution and those who drafted it intended to give the President and the powers he subsequently acquired. The result is a very interesting example of how circumstances and personality can change the constitution.\n\nThe constitution originally left policy and decision-making to the prime minister and his government (articles 20-23). Article twelve, granting the power to dissolve parliament, was meant to allow only a short exchange with the public. According to Michel Debr\u00e9, the President was only to assume the role of constitutional dictator in times of grave trouble (Article 16). In a brilliant exegesis of the constitution, which he largely authored, Michel Debr\u00e9 said the President's role was to be that of an arbiter, to oversee the constitution, and to be \"beyond politics and the political parties.\"\n\nThis seems to have been somewhat unrealistic. Neither the war in Algeria nor, despite appearances, the personality of de Gaulle would allow him to be the arbiter of the constitution.\n\nThe 1962 referendum gave the President the legitimacy of the public vote.

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat', a similar r\u00f4le to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible.

In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debr\u00e9, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reserv\u00e9\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere.

The education system needed immediate modernisation and democratization. The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

A cycle of observation for two years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11. The idea was that during these two years, pupils' progress would be observed, and at the end of the cycle, each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lyc\u00e9e or the CEG (coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions\u2014the lyc\u00e9e, the CEG, and the primary school\u2014and little transfer of pupils actually occurred (on average, only 1% of pupils transferred to the lyc\u00e9e). In these institutions, syllabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\n\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to address the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers, and trade unions by improving upon the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils\u2014the CES\u2014which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. This was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lyc\u00e9e into separate units and transforming the CEGs. At the end of the CES, entry to the lyc\u00e9e would be by the pupils' carte scolaire, not by exam. Lyc\u00e9e teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle-class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence, conversion was resisted. According to the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existence. However, the CES, as it was, did provide increased equality for pupils. The biggest drawback was the streaming system\u2014the three fili\u00e8res, of which fili\u00e8re number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class. This led to a continuation of social selection for the lyc\u00e9es and a further setback for democratization.", "speed": 0.4472986415604907, "eta": "00h14m20s"}

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair.

This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement.

It is a doctrine of resignation ie one is supposed to sit back and accept everything that happens. This is illustrated by the character of 'Pangloss', who is whipped, hung, and nearly burnt alive at an 'auto-da-f\u00e9', yet still believes in the theory of optimism.\n\n\tAs Candide starts out with a na\u00efve and perhaps cheerful look on life, he soon discovers man's evil nature and the atrocities that man inflicts on himself.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\".

Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union.

In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.\n\t\tThe Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body.

The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard to define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public.

This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is ever introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to \"buy British\", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result.

We must now consider the pros and cons of Britain joining \"The Single Market\".\n\t\tIn general we are already closely linked with the rest of Europe. Some believe that all that seperates us is the Channel. Soon, of course, this will become even less of a barrier with the completion of the \"Channel Tunnel\". When this tunnel, which will run under the water between England and France, is finally completed ( hopefully in the near future) it will be much easier to travel to and from Europe. The European countries will become more accessible. This is merely one step towards \"The Single Market\". There are also plans concerning trade barriers.\n\t\tSome people intend to drop all the barriers where trade and commerce are concerned. In this respect, it would become much easier to obtain items from Paris or Rome and a lot quicker. Imports and exports will also become more frequent and popular. We will be able to sell our goods from Britain to a wider range of customers in several more countries, just as, in the same way, we will also have the ability to buy more goods from a wider background. Buying and selling will become very important in \"The Single Market\" just as business will. Perhaps it will also be possible to accumulate shares from German or Spanish business and they, vice versa.\n\t\tIn order to aid \"The Single Market\" there are proposals at present, to introduce one monetary system into Europe, including Britain. If this becomes the case, there are those who believe that buying and selling and even travelling will become less difficult. The introduction of one monetary system would certainly ensure that the majority of problems concerning world-wide money comparisons would almost be abandoned.\n\t\tHowever, there are, of course, those who object to this one monetary system; Margaret Thatcher being one of the many.

The Single European Act of July 1987 was passed through Parliament by the Prime Minister (formerly Mrs. Thatcher) because of the single European market provision, which was beneficial to trade for the UK.\nUnfortunately, this Act also included other clauses that were overlooked and have now seriously affected the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\nBefore 1987, the Council of Ministers could impose directly applicable law upon the UK, which was enforceable in all UK courts. This effectively served to erode our sovereignty. Fortunately, no law could be passed without the UK's agreement, as a unanimous decision in the Council was required.

Unification would by implication involve a universal european adoption of common laws, in order to provide compatibility between the individual constituent nation states, and in order for those laws to be recognized by the courts of this country, these laws would need to be adopted in the U.K. in the ordinary way, ie. by enactment of Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would see this as a \"loan\" of sovereignty rather than a \"loss\", for they would claim that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy the U.K. might seize back this sovereignty by repealing the european statutes, in the ordinary way.\n\tIt could be claimed that the U.K. made its first steps to unification when it joined the European Community (E.C.) by the enactment of the European Communities Act 1972.

Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable.

This economic union will not really result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, fears exist that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain, since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision-making in the Council of Ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\nBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would impede Britain's decision-making ability. The recent incident of the European Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain highlights the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body is created. For example, the European Parliament believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel due to environmental concerns, an action that seemed to be an imposition on Britain's sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community were to introduce a single currency, Britain might lose its sovereignty since it would lose its individuality and its bargaining position on foreign exchange. Currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept.\n\nIf a single Europe leads to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of their own nation, most sovereignty would be lost.", "speed": 0.47947771867870154, "eta": "00h11m09s"}

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.  As the EEC assumes ever greater proportions the debate, particularly in Britain, is centred around a potential loss of sovereignty as the member states look to integrate further.\n\tParliament is no longer the sole source of English law.  As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - that is without the interference of Parliament.  The Single European Act has given rise to more majority voting in the European instititions which means it becomes increasingly possible to introduce legislation in the U.K. to which no one here has agreed.

As John Chaplin, an Olympic track official and veteran track-and-field coach, pointed out, the only way to clean up sports is to institute random testing. In the article \"A Game of Cat and Mouse,\" he stated that random drug testing would include testing in which officials would be permitted to swoop down unannounced at U.S. meets and conduct tests.\n\nThe article \"OK to NCAA\" states that drug testing does not infringe on athletes' right to privacy because the tests do not come as a surprise. Athletes are notified in advance that they will be tested. Without drug testing, competition is biased because those using drugs would have an edge over those who are obeying the rules. Therefore, the importance of drug testing outweighs the impairment of the right to privacy, and there is no other reasonable alternative.", "speed": 0.46537320313823155, "eta": "00h10m21s"}

Today, the\nAmerican flag garners little attention and a public prayer contradicts\nconstitutional law. But why does praying in public schools receive such\na negative reputation? There is a strong movement in the United States\nto bring back prayer to the schoolhouse. The argument used to support\nthe use of prayer in public schools, however, relies too heavily on\nshaky speculation, fallacies, and fanaticism for effectiveness. Those\nwho oppose prayer in public schools focus on fairness and equality to\neverybody rendering their argument much more convincing and acceptable.\nAn easy claim to make, and one that frequently appears in arguments for\nthe use of prayer in public school, states that <*>. This may seem like\nan encouraging thought but it nevertheless displays na\u00efvet\u00e9 and wishful\nreasoning. A prayer alone cannot subdue major societal problems. Trying\nto get a troubled youth out of a gang for example, with a prayer in\nschool compares to trying to extinguish a burning house with a thimble\nfull of water. It is just not enough to be effective. A thorough\nreligious awakening may help alleviate significant problems that plague\nyouth but a daily prayer in school hardly qualifies as this.\nAlso, a side overlooked by supporters of prayer in public schools points\nout that <*>. This fact strengthens the argument for not allowing prayer\nin public schools. Supporters often point to the fact that teen\npregnancy, violence, and drug abuse among youths is increasing since the\nban of school prayer.

Today, the American flag garners little attention, and a public prayer contradicts constitutional law. But why does praying in public schools receive such a negative reputation? There is a strong movement in the United States to bring back prayer to the schoolhouse. The argument used to support the use of prayer in public schools, however, relies too heavily on shaky speculation, fallacies, and fanaticism for effectiveness. Those who oppose prayer in public schools focus on fairness and equality for everyone, rendering their argument much more convincing and acceptable.\n\nAn easy claim to make, and one that frequently appears in arguments for the use of prayer in public schools, states that it can unify students and promote a sense of community. This may seem like an encouraging thought, but it nevertheless displays naivety and wishful reasoning. A prayer alone cannot subdue major societal problems. Trying to get a troubled youth out of a gang, for example, with a prayer in school compares to trying to extinguish a burning house with a thimble full of water. It is just not enough to be effective.\n\nAnother side overlooked by supporters of prayer in public schools points out that since the ban of school prayer, teen pregnancy, violence, and drug abuse among youths have been on the rise. This fact strengthens the argument for not allowing prayer in public schools. Supporters often point to the fact that these issues are increasing, claiming that prayer could have prevented them. However, these facts do not accurately show that prayer leads to moral virtue. Too many uncontrolled variables, such as an increase in broken homes and violence on television, may distort results. During the time when prayer existed in public schools, moral tarnishes like segregation, lynchings, and the oppression of women blemished society. It appears as though America has made significant gains in moral awareness. \n\nIn short, because there is no data showing that prayer actually causes a better educational or social environment, there is no reason to allow its inclusion in public schools.", "speed": 0.46537320313823155, "eta": "00h10m21s"}

Advances in genetic research have put modern medicine in the\nposition to see future, untreatable, hereditary conditions such as\nHuntington's Disease. This new knowledge of genetics is leading to a\nmuch more profound discovery. Scientists are now attempting to map the\nhuman genome, which when done will unlock the mysteries of human\ngenetics and will give doctors the ability not only to eliminate certain\ndisease carrying genes, but also to manipulate others.\nThis new genetic research has led to many controversies over the project\nto map the human genome and to many debates concerning the ethical\nconsequences if the research continues. Arguments are framed for both\nsides of the issue from not only doctors and scientists, but also from\nthe layman, as ethical issues are not considered to belong to only a\ngroup of experts, but everyone.

Scientists and doctors have pushed their studies to the point of being material for science fiction stories. It is evident that genetic research has come a long way from crossbreeding different pea plants. Advances in genetic research have put modern medicine in a position to foresee future, untreatable, hereditary conditions such as Huntington's Disease. This new knowledge of genetics is leading to much more profound discoveries. Scientists are now attempting to map the human genome, which, when done, will unlock the mysteries of human genetics and give doctors the ability not only to eliminate certain disease-carrying genes but also to manipulate others.\n\nThis new genetic research has led to many controversies over the project to map the human genome and to many debates concerning the ethical consequences if the research continues. Arguments are framed for both sides of the issue not only by doctors and scientists but also by the layman, as ethical issues are not considered to belong to only a group of experts but to everyone. To convince readers that genetic research and its application could be detrimental, one must present a very strong argument. This argument must contain a large amount of information to cover all aspects of the subject and must refute any counterarguments.

Suicide means the end of all problems (Though those problems\nare usually solved easily.) This topic has many sides but can be\nanalyzed with two: those who advocate rational suicide and those who\noppose it.

They feel no pity for the\nperson who committed suicide either. Yet, others speak of the\ninvolvement of religion in the lives of those that attempt and commit\nsuicide. The opponents of suicide often neglect to prove their\nstatements. All the statements that people make are good statements\nthat, with some thought, can be rationalized. The opponents simply fail\nto provide the evidence for the rationalization of their arguments.\nThe authors of the first argument fail to prove it. The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish. He does not feel that there is any\nsuicide that can be considered rational because all suicide fails to\nthink about the effects of a suicide on others. He states that <*>. Mr\nRauscher hopes to convey that the only thing that people who commit\nsuicide do is think about whether they should end their own pains. Yet,\nRauscher fails to analyze his opposition. He should ask what does the\nperson attempting suicide thinking? The person may be thinking about his\nfamily and friends when he or she attempts suicide. For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous.\nMaybe Mr Rauscher does not think about what the sight of that pain and\nthe family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their\nemotions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Many events in our lives have consequences, but none are as drastic as suicide.

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers.

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific tasks, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contributions to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about the values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money, and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a perennial subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor\u2014valuable contributions\u2014with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take their employment seriously\u2014let alone find satisfaction in employment\u2014without considering the fundamental value of child care providers.

The amount of that financial reward, unfortunately, has become equated with worth as a person. However, most of the traditional household roles formerly performed by women exclusively (but now handled by people of both sexes) have never been compensated by the dollar. This poses a problem, since undoubtedly those at-home tasks contribute services to society equally valuable in comparison to marketplace \"jobs\". Therefore, in order for society to fully acknowledge the value of both types of jobs--in the home and outside the home, some sort of compensation should be made for \"home-making service\" as well as for he or she who works outside the home.\nThe career with a capital C is traditionally seen as the route to performing a service to society worth rewarding with a paycheck. Certainly doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs contribute invaluable resources to human civilization and deserve to be compensated for their labors. Teachers, engineers, artists, politicians and all those who enrich our lives and our cultures, and on whom we depend, are indispensable to society. Whether they be male or female has no bearing on the size of their reward; \"equal pay for equal work\" is a well-worded and time-honored phrase.\nBut what is \"equal work\"? It is fairly easy to establish equity between marketplace jobs with duties and responsibilities that are roughly similar. That is, a teacher of sophomore high school English and a teacher of senior high school English perform comparable tasks and therefore should be equally compensated. But how do we compare raising a family of four children over a period of twenty-five years to the job of an neurosurgeon over the same period of time? I know of no culture on this globe that pays a woman (or a man, for that matter) a yearly salary of $50,000 for nurturing and educating children from the cradle to near-dependence.

This is a very simple support of reward equaling effort.\n\nBringing this to a more present time, we are now reaping the benefits of advanced technology, expanding knowledge, and modern times. We have many machines to help us meet our food, clothing, and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part. Persons with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor. However, just as in earlier days, the harder you work, the greater the reward.\n\nLet's imagine a society where all men and women were treated equally. All basic survival needs (and even wants for that matter) were provided regardless of the effort put forth. I would venture to guess that we would not be as advanced a society as we are today. Competitiveness and jealousy would set in, and fights would occur. Worst-case scenario: the world would become divided or even destroyed because someone was sitting on the sidelines and not doing their share. We would not have motivation to develop our talents and abilities and use them in a way to benefit others. Our society would become selfish, hoarding, and our culture would suffer. It may be a pessimistic view, but I feel it is a very real one to say that we would become lazy and stagnant people.", "speed": 0.4577585599903822, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

If one has preconceived notions concerning one's salary, one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others. \"Contribution to society\" is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate \"equally'.\nIn the 1920s in American, it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living, but merely lived off the interest of their investments. The stock market was experiencing a boom, and several formerly working-class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early. But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites; they received money, but they contributed nearly nothing to society.\nPeople who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill, some sort of excitement that money cannot buy.

A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault (or bad luck).

Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter.

I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touch their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the \"I'd rather do it myself\" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, whether you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitude of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.\nNow, after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to be in the 60's, and not looking down on females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home. \nNowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and take care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed.

These people are usually somewhat less educated and believe what they do is essential for survival. I cannot comment on whether there is a valid reason for committing a crime or not, but I do know that life for some people is very difficult. Unless someone can really feel and understand what others go through, they have no room to judge. This type of crime very rarely pays off, because the criminals just are not that good. People often tell others what they did, and the word soon gets out. In many cases, there are witnesses to the acts. Aside from that, these criminals just do not have the money. This leads me to my next part.", "speed": 0.4577585599903822, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime. Being a criminal has it's advantages; you don't have to worry about being fired, you can make more money in less time, you set up your own hours because you're your own boss, and you can retire well before the age of 65.\n\nLet's take time to compare the criminal life to the life of the hard working person. In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If he/she invest half this money and earns interest they could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I beg to differ; crime does pay.

This amounts to $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions run about $69.00 per week, and deductions for medical/dental insurance cost an additional $5.00 per week, bringing their actual take-home pay to $266.00 per week. A criminal, on the other hand, can work one hour a day and earn $300.00 without having to worry about deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Furthermore, the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific number of hours each day; they are their own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker is retirement. However, the criminal can retire much faster if they have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works 5 hours per week until age 30, they could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years, the criminal earns $1,170,000.00. If they invest half of this money and earn interest, they could potentially live on the interest income alone.\n\nComparing both options here, I'd definitely say that crime does pay.", "speed": 0.4577585599903822, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening.

Ogburn recognized that personality was becoming an important characteristic in a mate. Also, sociologists Ernest W. Burgess and Harvey J. Locke noted in 1945 that family solidarity was increasingly coming to depend on mutual affection, sympathetic understanding, and temperamental compatibility. Society has become impersonal and complex, so people want their marriage to satisfy their needs for intimacy.\n\nExpectations for marriage have become high. We have the unrealistic idea that love is the symbol of total happiness. If there is \"true love,\" then all our needs will be satisfied. People enter marriage with unrealistic expectations of love, then when dissatisfactions enter, spouses tend to blame one another. The symbol of love blinds them to the reality of marriage.\n\nThe roles of children and parents have changed, leading to increased pressure on marriages.", "speed": 0.4577585599903822, "eta": "00h09m21s"}

Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires.

Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered.

For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien's \"invention\" for intentions not worthy of the genius; namely: atomic bombs.\n\tThe significance of atomic bombs cannot be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century.

Unfortunately this still occurs, but with increasing medical & technological advances starting at the middle of the century many people have been rescued from the torment of disease.

It changed the population  and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.\n\t For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease.

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too.

Though advances in communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk.  In the second of the world wars, the race was on to create the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known.

Should there be a fire in the house, many people might be seen frantically running about in the streets, clutching the machine tightly to their chests. In today's society, being without a washing machine, or any other electric gadget, seems devastating. What would a college student do without a washing machine? Where would we find the time to hand wash our clothes?\n\nThe mere thought of washing clothes by hand causes panic in most teenagers, students, and adults alike. This modern invention, the washing machine, has instilled a fear of hand-washing clothes in many. Give an average adult a washboard and soap, and watch the panicked look on their face.\n\nThus, it is easy to see that while washing machines, microwaves, toaster ovens, and millions of other gadgets facilitate our modern lives, they also contribute to our modern rush. These \"wonders\" make it easier to spend less time doing manual labor. But is that all that bad? Many housewives would insist on its benefits, and I would have to agree. But the washing machine is just another invention in a long line of inventions that make our lives easier yet don't allow us to exercise, to use our muscles. It is no small wonder that in today's \"modern\" society, as we continuously use our \"modern gadgets,\" we increasingly need diet programs and other such systems.\n\nYes, the old days were hard, but was Weight Watchers ever an issue?", "speed": 0.4712132160109825, "eta": "00h07m57s"}

This discovery of AIDS has changed how people think, live, and view mortality.  At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.

A system that seemed to work, many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and or newspaper where they could get the day's information easily and completely. And, in the case of the radio, all was almost immediate. Description of sporting events, voices acting out stories, persons of the government speaking directly to the people, the radio seemed the perfect solution to countries with its citizens living at all ends of its boarders.\n\tThe advent of the television changed all of that, however, giving the public a \"peak\" at what radio wasn't able to give them. Along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world, the television was able to add images- pictures that enhanced the entire absorbtion of what was being broadcast. Where once a reporter's voice described a scene, now the people could see for themselves what was happening because, for the most part, it was happening in front of their eyes.\n\tBesides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewer, the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together. A president of one country can be seen and heard in a country far away giving his views and ideas so that all can \"understand\" him. The small town store owner can watch her son in his olympic race as it's happening without spening thousands to travel to see him in person. The examples could be endless.\n\tThe television strength must be realized, however, as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more.

It was mainly used though, by corporations and government to process the huge amounts of information that they needed to gather. At that time the ordinary everyday person had no need to process information as we do today.

Once \"soft lenses\" were introduced to the public, the \"lense craze\" caught on rapidly and hasn't died down yet. I got my first pair of contact lenses when I was fourteen years old.\n\nI had been wearing glasses since the time I was ten, and I was tired of being limited in certain athletic activities because of my vision. At the time, I played basketball; if I wore my glasses, they would end up on the floor, and if I didn't wear them, I'd be more or less \"blind.\" Also, I enjoyed swimming\u2014even though I could hardly see far enough in front of me to see where I was headed! After my eyes adjusted to the initial \"sting\" when I inserted my first pair of lenses, I knew that my glasses would be placed in my desk drawer and stay there!\n\nAbout two years ago, another type of lenses became accessible to the public. They're called \"disposables,\" and I can't even begin to explain what a difference they make. You can wear them for a week and then throw them away\u2014no worries about cleaning them and taking them out every night before going to sleep. It's such a great feeling to wake up in the morning, open your eyes, and see perfectly!", "speed": 0.4712132160109825, "eta": "00h07m57s"}

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.

A machine gun can be used to keep civil peace, enforce Marshall Law.  The radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship, propaganda.\n\tIn the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives (except for those that it' s killed), but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact.\n\tThe idea behind the radio is simple.  There is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air, waves, with potential for millions of receivers.  In the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment.\n\tRadio keeps people informed.  I don' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different.  Every morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly.  At night one can sit by the radio  and hear how the events of the day unfolded.  Radio, hence, gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process.

Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty. Death would have been quick, easy, and more economical. Susan Smith is now living with a guilty conscience, a sentence that is far greater than death.

Instead of viewing the enjoyment of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allow the enjoyment of the differences to increase social well. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlining driving force of opposite sex interaction. While men and women are naturally different, the laws of the land must treat everyone equally. With fairness alone in mind there has been a resent social mood to permanently disintegrate the sacred differences between males and females. Men and women can enjoy there differences, especially physical differences, while remaining fair to themselves as well as remaining fair to the opposite sex.\n\tRecently there has been a trend to facilitate an equal playing field for both female and male athletes. By law we should equally fund all sexes sports, but in reality some sports bring in more revenue than others. The classic example is the relatively male sport of football in relation to women's volleyball. At my high school I had people argue about the disproportionally funded sports. They would not necessarily argue that volleyball should get funded equally with football, but that if the football team has the second best facilities in the state then the volleyball team should have the second best facilities.

Instead of viewing the enjoyment of the inherent differences between males and females as a negative part of social life, we can allow the enjoyment of the differences to increase social welfare. Women and men are, of course, different physically and emotionally. These differences are the underlying driving force of opposite-sex interaction. While men and women are naturally different, the laws of the land must treat everyone equally. With fairness alone in mind, there has recently been a social mood to permanently eliminate the sacred differences between males and females. Men and women can enjoy their differences, especially physical differences, while remaining fair to themselves and to the opposite sex.\n\nRecently, there has been a trend to facilitate an equal playing field for both female and male athletes. By law, we should equally fund all sports, but in reality, some sports generate more revenue than others. The classic example is the relatively male sport of football compared to women's volleyball. At my high school, people argued about the disproportionately funded sports. They would not necessarily argue that volleyball should receive equal funding with football but that if the football team has the second-best facilities in the state, the volleyball team should have the second-best facilities as well.

There are many reasons why there should be a salary cap. For one, most of the professional football players make more money than a college graduate does.

Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong.

We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding.

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of a patient's\nrecovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

The people that I know who sell marijuana had nice clothes and drove nice cars. The Columbian suppliers make millions every year.

These officials are often the same ones who insist on its illegality.\n\nAs I delved deeper into this complex world, I came to realize that in many European countries, you can buy marijuana like you buy a pack of cigarettes. At first, this seemed odd to me because, as a child, I had only seen it and never actually experienced it. I didn't really know what marijuana was. Then, one day, I had a conversation with a Jamaican man we called Black Mosses. He explained it all to me. He told me that marijuana was natural because it was a plant that came from the earth and could be used in its natural form, unlike cocaine, which is processed and often contains impurities.", "speed": 0.44791524678016587, "eta": "00h07m10s"}

The welfare program would be successful if it changed to include a time limit, training programs that are required, less government funding for certain welfare programs, and abolishing the law that states that women should get more money for having more children.\nBoth parties agree on having time limits and training programs so that welfare recipients can find jobs (Economist 33).  It is important for recipients to work for their welfare check so that they do not become dependent on the system.

These training programs would help most women who have been on welfare for years.  \"These women have so little work experience that they have to rehearse with social workers to remember to say ,good-bye, and thank you, at the end of an interview\" (Whitman\n30).\nIn Chicago, a highly regarded training program, Project match, has given a mix of education, training, counseling, and job-placement to its clients and has gotten half of them off of welfare.

She has been on welfare for nine years and lost half of her 517 dollar welfare payment for refusing to look for a job.  She then entered a highschool equivalency diploma program and does her homework every night (whitman 36-37).

The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers.

Kids are dying for our country in wars, but the government still will not allow them to drink. How can you be considered a man and fight in combat when the government says you are too young to do what all other adults can? If you can hold a gun and fight for your country, you should be able to experience the effects of drinking alcohol.\n\nKids are getting into too much trouble trying to hide their drinking from their parents. Most kids between eighteen and twenty are out of high school, and their parents do not care what they do. A high school diploma should signify that you are old enough to make mature decisions. While some eighteen-year-olds do not have a diploma, a rule could be made that if you do not have a diploma and are under twenty-one, then you are not allowed to drink. This might encourage a higher percentage of teenagers to graduate, thinking that if they had a diploma they could do anything an adult can.\n\nThere would likely be less crime among teenagers in the United States if eighteen was the legal drinking age. Most crimes among teenagers are related to drinking and driving. They are forced to drink and drive because they try to hide it from their parents. They cannot drink in their own households, so they have to do it somewhere their parents would not find out. If", "speed": 0.45053923295723086, "eta": "00h05m57s"}

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers.

I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention.

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that has been constantly debated for over two decades, and these debates have only expanded throughout the years.

According to this argument, a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did. However, this argument is not substantial if we examine the true meaning of \"genocide.\" Genocide, as defined, is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial, or cultural group. The analogy is flawed because abortion does not involve systematically targeting and destroying a specific group of people.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over abortion highlights the complexity of moral and ethical considerations. While opinions on this issue are deeply held and often passionate, it is essential to examine the arguments critically and recognize that the decision to have an abortion should ultimately be based on the individual circumstances and the woman's best judgment.", "speed": 0.45053923295723086, "eta": "00h05m57s"}

Currently to administer capital punishment upon a single individ ual it costs five times the amount than it would to inprison somebody from the age of eighteen to eighty years old.  How this statement can be valid is due to the reasons that when someone recieves the death penalty they are not killed the next day.  Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years.  During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals.  These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs.  When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system.  This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system.

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and people today are realizing that it is an issue that will not go away.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment.

However, as we are realizing, a person's heritage is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to fit the model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor, and excitement to the \"pot\" of our people.\n\nHowever, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences and choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Wiesel, author of such books as *Night*, says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good\u2014love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life, and growth. Their familiar ontonyms are not indifference but acceptance.\n\nEthnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American cultures. The gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make its writing unique. In many cases, the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue.\" For instance, Native American poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American literature is philosophical and literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic, mirroring their similar achievements in jazz and blues music.

The transmission of culture is a very important aspect of ethnic American literature. Many ethnic American writers show the importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native country.\nMany of the novels we have read this semester show this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. The mothers want to desperately hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters \"the Chinese way\". They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are. Where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues. The daughters find this hard to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions - the doors for transmition of culture have been opened. Amy Tan's novel ends with this important aspect of ethnic literature. Another novel that shows transmition of culture is Walker's The Color Purple.

The transmission of culture is a very important aspect of ethnic American literature. Many ethnic American writers emphasize the importance of transmitting culture or tradition from generation to generation, perhaps to uphold the customs and traditions of their native countries.\n\nMany of the novels we have read this semester illustrate this aspect of transmitting culture. For example, the predominant novel to show this is Amy Tan's *The Joy Luck Club*. The mothers want desperately to hold on to the old ways of China and try to raise their daughters \"the Chinese way.\" They tell their daughters stories of China and basically try to tell them about the people they are\u2014where they came from, who they are, and why they act the way they do about certain issues. The daughters find this hard to understand because they have been Americanized. By the end of the novel, all the daughters understand their foreign mothers and learn to accept their traditions. The doors for the transmission of culture have been opened. Amy Tan's novel ends with this important aspect of ethnic literature.\n\nAnother novel that shows the transmission of culture is Alice Walker's *The Color Purple*. Celie's sister Nettie goes off to Africa as a missionary. Once there, she tries to transmit African-American culture to the natives. Finally, in Esquivel's *Like Water for Chocolate*, Mama Elena tries to transmit culture to Tita and her other daughters.

However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression.

Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate.

There was a group of scholars in France, l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, that set guidelines for French literature. According to l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais, all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature.  However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.  \nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they did not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide \"kills\" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels. The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When Voltaire wrote *Candide*, a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak.

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another.

It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others.

There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed.

This is especially true in the major cities such as London and Birmingham and this can be seen in the horrific traffic problems which plague these cities. When faced with large traffic jams there is the tendancy to find shortcuts and this can lead to heavy traffic through rural villages or residential areas. The number of heavy goods vehicles on the road networks has also increased and frequent lorry traffic can damage roads not built for this purpose quickly. They also restrict the flow of traffic on motorways especially when in large numbers.\nThe rail transport in the United Kingdom also has many problems. One of these is the increasing number of people who prefer to drive rather than catch a train.

It has an inadequate and expensive public transport system which as a result is forcing more and more cars onto the road. Britain now has the most cars per mile of road anywhere in the world and modern traffic policies are not tackling these problems. In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to \"fill in the gaps\".

In short, a somewhat more radical and unpopular policy is required.\n\nBritish Rail is notoriously slow, late, and expensive, and the hype surrounding rail travel and steam trains is long gone. Many old tracks have been dismantled. If we are to alleviate the congestion on Britain\u2019s roads, we must encourage rail travel and open new lines rather than closing old ones. Perhaps the privatization of British Rail will produce a more competitive service, but I fear it will result in the closure of smaller, less profitable lines and better service only on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world, even developing countries, runs a reliable service. Few efforts have been made to make fares cheaper and more desirable for family travel; the Family Railcard has been a non-starter.\n\nUntil the rail service improves, people will continue to use the increasingly clogged-up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution; the number of cars on the roads will simply increase to \u201cfill in the gaps.\u201d With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days in a row, I can sympathize with the protestors.

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nThe reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport. There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport.

People engage in fox hunting primarily to kill foxes, which they perceive as a threat to their chickens, and to enjoy the social aspects of the sport. In the present day, farmers can certainly develop methods to prevent foxes from attacking their chickens. If they implement such measures, there would be no need for hunting and killing foxes, which would solve the problem.\n\nWhen hunts occur, other wildlife is also harmed alongside the foxes. Homes of animals may be destroyed, and innocent animals may suffer. Once captured, foxes are said to suffer a horrible death, and if this continues, it will be unfair. Many people do not have a problem with foxes and believe the hunt should not be a sport; after all, it is not enjoyable to experience the suffering of an animal. Fewer foxes killed would mean fewer rabbits, which would benefit many farmers and is not cruel but a way of life.\n\nFox hunting is a cruel sport, as foxes are pursued by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is relentlessly chased until it is caught. This is a deeply upsetting scenario, and most people would be relieved if fox hunting were banned. Foxes have as much right to live on this earth as we do, and we should find a different method to deal with the situation. It is clear that nobody would wish foxes to go through such torment, so there is no reason to subject them to it. If foxes can no longer harm farm animals, there is no danger in banning the sport.\n\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to maintain the fox population at a manageable level and prevent changes in the food chain. Foxes are not necessary for controlling the rabbit population; farmers can use poisons to eliminate rabbits. If fox hunting is banned, it means that protesters have won, and this may give them an incentive to protest about other issues.", "speed": 0.45214113844422765, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Do not rewrite for clarity unless absolutely necessary.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nOne of the main arguments put forward for the abolishment of boxing is the fact that the continual pressure exerted on a boxer whilst being hit can result in death, or terminal injury.\nEach time a punch hits a boxer on the head, the brain gets jerked from one side of the head to the other, and finally stops as it hits the inner wall of the temple. One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health. \nAlso, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\nHowever, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing.

Each time a punch hits a boxer on the head, the brain gets jerked from one side of the head to the other and finally stops as it hits the inner wall of the temple. One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid, which is gradually worn down, leaving the brain tissue with very little protection and making it susceptible to serious damage.\n\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3-minute rounds, and during this time, they may only get hit 100 times in this 18-minute period. A professional boxer usually only has about three fights a year, which, they argue, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each fight and may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health.\n\nAdditionally, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport and that it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that they can no longer continue to fight. Boxers may train for up to six hours a day, building up their strength to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\n\nHowever, despite the highly publicized deaths of some fighters, such as James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, such as horse riding or motor car racing. Great precautions are taken to make boxing as safe as possible, with several paramedics on hand if needed.\n\nFurthermore, no one is forcing boxers to fight. They have the decision as to whether or not they should participate in a boxing match. Surely the choice should be theirs to make?", "speed": 0.45214113844422765, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in the sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain.

Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery was criticized before its introduction as \"a tax on the stupid.\" This criticism has two main aspects. Firstly, it is aimed at the government for attempting to raise revenue without introducing a new tax, exploiting the already unpopular nature of taxation. The government was aware of the public's strong opposition to taxation and marketed the lottery as a game rather than a means to generate additional revenue. Not only was the government criticized for taking any money from the lottery, but also for its share, which inevitably came at the expense of the lottery's \"good causes.\"\n\nThe objection that the lottery was \"a tax on the stupid\" also targeted its marketing. Critics argued that the marketing companies emphasized the likelihood of winning, despite the statistical improbability. The slogan \"it could be you\" faced intense scrutiny. \n\nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people view the lottery reasonably, not exceeding their budget based on their income. The fear that people would spend more than they could afford, believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, appears to be unfounded. These studies indicate that lottery spending increases with income, with the poor spending the least and the rich spending the most. This suggests that there are not as many \"stupid\" people as originally claimed by critics.\n\nRegarding the criticism directed at the government, there was no concealment of the government's share. Other forms of gambling and most spending are taxed, including Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect the government to refrain from taxing the lottery.\n\nThe lottery was also criticized for misrepresenting the allocation of funds, particularly for its \"good causes\" and charities. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity was overemphasized and the figures were exaggerated. Critics contended that the introduction of the lottery would significantly harm charitable donations.", "speed": 0.45214113844422765, "eta": "00h03m34s"}

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points.

Consequently many people who may have otherwise not gambled, become addicted to gambling.\nSecondly, gambling is indulged in by a large number of people on lower incomes, who attempt to win prizes to improve their low standard of living. Due to the massive sizes of some of the Lottery jackpots many people are persuaded to spend large proportions of their income on trying to win an amount of money that would considerably change their life.\nAnother critisism is of the size of the jackpots themselves. Many people believe that the size of the main prizes are so great that winners find it difficult to comprehend the amount of money they have won and consequently it is often spent or invested unwisely. Also because of the amount of money won winning the Lottery jackpot can often run peoples lives. Many people claim, after winning a jackpot, you slowly lose friends and can become completely cut off from the lifestyle you were previously used to. In fact it is claimed that the only way to keep friends is to not mention that you have won the jackpot.\nHowever the Lottery also has its beneficial aspects: The lottery raises an enormous amount of revenue for the Government, which would otherwise to have been raised through increased taxes. This money is mostly then invested into important institutions by the Heritage Fund. Consequently it has enabled the survival of many theatres and other places of historic and cultural interest. Another positive point is that the Lottery is entirely voluntary; those who disapprove need to pay.\n Also the lottery helps to retain small shops and newsagents from being 'chased out of business' by bigger chains and supermarkets. The Lottery organiser, Camelot decided to only sell the lottery tickets from small shops and post-offices to increase their trade and also they gain some of the revenue (around 5p in every \u00a31) from the tickets.\nClearly the National Lottery has its positive and negative aspects.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When the National Lottery was introduced, 14 months ago, there were many arguments put forward as to why it should survive, or alternatively why it was harmful.\n\nThe main objections to the Lottery were as follows: Firstly, by publicising a gambling event on such a wide scale, it brings gambling to a wider audience than it would otherwise have.

Due to the massive sizes of some of the Lottery jackpots, many people are persuaded to spend large proportions of their income on trying to win an amount of money that would considerably change their life. Another criticism is of the size of the jackpots themselves. Many people believe that the size of the main prizes is so great that winners find it difficult to comprehend the amount of money they have won, and consequently it is often spent or invested unwisely. Also, because of the amount of money won, winning the Lottery jackpot can often run one's life. Many people claim that after winning a jackpot, you slowly lose friends and can become completely cut off from the lifestyle you were previously used to. In fact, it is claimed that the only way to keep friends is to not mention that you have won the jackpot.\n\nHowever, the Lottery also has its beneficial aspects: The lottery raises an enormous amount of revenue for the Government, which would otherwise have been raised through increased taxes. This money is mostly then invested into important institutions by the Heritage Fund, consequently enabling the survival of many theatres and other places of historic and cultural interest. Another positive point is that the Lottery is entirely voluntary; those who disapprove need not participate. Additionally, the lottery helps to retain small shops and newsagents from being 'chased out of business' by bigger chains and supermarkets. The Lottery organizer, Camelot, decided to only sell lottery tickets from small shops and post-offices to increase their trade, and they gain some of the revenue (around 5p in every \u00a31) from the tickets.\n\nClearly, the National Lottery has both positive and negative aspects.", "speed": 0.46023760135792896, "eta": "00h02m21s"}

Some people have become millionaires overnight because their numbers have been picked out. However, before the first draw was made, heated debate centred around the fact that should the National Lottery even exist?\nDuring the debate many interested parties stated their objections to the National Lottery. One of Britain's most famous businesses and Families had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies and Littlewards, in particular, were particularly worried about the start of the National Lottery. They were worried that people instead of spending money on the 'pools', would stake a \u00a31 on the National Lottery instead. This was a major part of their argument, that the National Lottery would take their business away and due to this they would have no need to employ as many workers, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, already an unemployment problem spot.\nCharities were worried that they would lose out. They had been promised a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) going to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon. Clubs and charities who sold scratch cards as a source of income were worried because they thought nobody would buy their cards. They could not offer large money prizes like the Lottery. More worries were expressed when the Lottery's own scratch cards were introduced, possibly meaning even less money for charities.\nLarge debate centred around which organisations stood to benefit from the profits made by the Lottery. Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed. Sports teams, clubs, social groups and communities applied for cash for new facilities and then John Major announced some profits would be used for the construction of a British Academy of Sport. However, people were worried that the money would not be evenly spread, would the North-South divide be a factor?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "National Lottery draws have become a regular part of Saturday nights for most British families.

One of Britain\u2019s most famous bookmakers, William Hill, had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies, including William Hill, and Littlewoods were particularly worried about the National Lottery. They were concerned that people would choose to spend their money on the National Lottery instead of on the pools, which would result in a loss of business. This, they argued, would lead to a decrease in the number of employees, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, an area already struggling with high unemployment rates.\n\nCharities were also worried about potential losses. They had been promised a cut of the profits, with roughly 40p in the pound going to charities. However, calculations showed that charities might lose out as collections would no longer bring in the vital funds they relied upon.

There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child's ability to learn. The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the \"problem\". The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children. However, parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn.

Computers now dominate the majority of government business, science and communication, as well as many other areas of human life. In many ways, it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes.\n\tThe most obvious example of this is the calculator, an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations. This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations, and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer. This, unfortunately, means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator, who needs only to know which buttons to press.

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB.

If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products.

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby.

This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships. However, if much older women have children, she is less likely to be able to care for them when they are older. It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you. Also, it may not be fair on the mother, as if the treatment was available she may feel obliged to have children for her partner.

This could lead to a total change in the population. Also, if for any reason the treatment should go wrong and the wrong gender is conceived, the parents may find it hard to love the child.

This has in some ways been carried out for centuries by cross-breeding to obtain desired features. Carrying it out genetically would give more control. Genetic manipulation of viruses could mean that they could be used to carry useful genetic information around the body and implant it into other cells.\n\nMany moral problems are raised with such advances. Do we have the right to play God? Should we be able to choose the features of our children? More importantly, is it right to deprive a child of life because of genetic defects, which is likely to raise the most argument?\n\nAlong with the moral problems, there are also physical dangers with 'tampering' with genetics. We are using bacteria and viruses to find vaccinations and cures, but there is a possibility that 'super' viruses or bacteria could be produced, which our bodies could not defend against and could wipe out entire populations. There is the chance that this is done purposefully, such as in biological warfare, in which the effects could be catastrophic.\n\nThe moral argument is difficult. Who, at the end of the day, has the right to make this decision? What about medical uses already in practice, such as the production of insulin for diabetics, which has been made possible by genetic advancements? Very few people would argue that there is a moral problem with that. So where can the line be drawn?\n\nIt is an argument that will reappear and become more fierce as each new genetic step is discovered.", "speed": 0.4641428292707947, "eta": "00h01m11s"}

This is where the computer is used. Computers are able to run much faster than the human brain and without doubt they are able to hold much more information on a vast range of topics. Humans grow ever more dependant on computers as the technology continues to advance. The ability the computer has to process information and present it in a fashion in which we can understand it is amazing. It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them. If a human would have been in the same position the error would have more chance of being detected and the product would have a better change of being satisfactory. Although in this situation the human would take longer to process the order there would be a greater chance of the correct finished product that the attempt by the computer. However if the correct program is loaded into the computer it is a much more efficient method of production. This is well illustrated in the car manufacturing industry of today.

For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.\nIf people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead? The answer is pork, lamb and other meats. The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef.

However farmers with crops would be trying to increase their field and also increaseing their prices as demand increases.\nThis therefore leads to the conclusion that if people cease to eat meat due to becoming vegetarians or because of the risk of their mental health followed by a slow death economic upset will occur. In otherwords the collapse of one part of the aggricultural industry and increased posit of other parts of aggricultural industry.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Beef could cease to be eaten in the UK due to increased diseases related to beef consumption. Bulls that produce beef sometimes catch BSE, a disease that makes them go mad. This disease is then believed to be passed on to humans through beef, causing mental health problems.\n\nThe effect on the UK agricultural industry would be devastating, as it is one of the biggest beef producers. If the UK stops eating beef, there would be no demand for beef imports, leading to a severe impact on the industry. Additionally, other countries would likely not want to import UK beef, as there would be no trade between them. This would result in a shift from beef farming to crops or pig farming, leading to the wastage of beef. The industry would require heavy government subsidies to restart and diversify. However, the cessation of beef eating would mean an increase in demand for crops, sheep, pigs, and other livestock. This would lead to increased purchases of livestock and crop seeds.\n\nThe agricultural industry could face a widespread collapse if other countries follow Britain's example of not eating beef.\n\nThe first noticeable change would be a drastic reduction in the price of beef. Farmers would no longer purchase beef stock but would try to sell it. At the same time, farmers with crops would try to increase their fields and prices due to higher demand.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that if people cease to eat meat, either by becoming vegetarians or due to concerns about their mental health, it would cause economic disruption. In other words, it would lead to the collapse of one part of the agricultural industry and an increased position for other parts of the industry.", "speed": 0.4641428292707947, "eta": "00h01m11s"}
