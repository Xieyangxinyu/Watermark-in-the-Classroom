When he returns to Argos, he cannot feel a part of the city for the simple reason that he is innocent, and feels innocent, whereas all those citizens born in Argos and living there, have supposedly been born into guilt. The whole point of the play seems to be an attack on the Church and religion (especially Catholic) which holds good considering Sartre's atheism.\nThe whole city of Argos is in perpetual mourning and repentence for a murder which happened unbeknown to many of them: for those who were around, guilt is theirs for not having prevented the atrocity. The Queen's mournful clothing and black funereal make-up emphasize the point: there is no happiness in the city. They are all allowing themselves to be ruled by the past and, in fact, seem to be in a time-warp, not moving forward, not even seeing their futures. All the features Sartre placed in the play show an exaggerated set-up of the real world and its religion. The fact that religion tells us we are guilty because we are human and we live governed by the murder of Christ which happened unbeknown to us, but we must still repent this sin. A significant attribute is the plague of flies around and in Argos, to enhance the picture of being totally enclosed and \"attacked\" by something which Sartre implies is all in the mind. This ability to shock his audience was an attribute he found very powerful and positive, in that he was thus guaranteed their attention and a reaction. Here, he has even placed a god \"on earth\" as it were, as if to prove that they are in fact no greater than us and the fact that they can produce miracles, has no bearing on their power over us and does in no way justify our servitude under them.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Oreste was born in Argos and, upon his father's death (who was, incidentally, murdered), he was taken to Athens to be raised by a noble family.

In seeking to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, ie the fact that man's inherent desire to seek out the truth of the world is defeated by the incomprehensible nature of the world and by his own mortality, one result of trying to do this is by portraying a guilty nature, refusing to accept the absurdity of life and trying to revolt against it by duplicity.\nLa Chute involves guilt of various types, allocated to different people. Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-p\u00e9nitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them. Clarence wishes his interlocutor were a policeman so that his confession would be acted upon, in spite of the fact that he really desires to judge others to regain his self-esteem than to be punished. To vividly demonstrate the sense of guilt he feels after his 'fall' he uses a legal concept, referring to the friends he once dominated <quote>.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In existentialist terms, guilt is a characteristic that often accompanies duplicity.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith. They seek refuge in religion, and according to Camus take a <quote>. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Le Mythe de Sisyphe is a novel that grapples with the complex and often contradictory nature of life.

This is innocent because he has no past experience. He believes that people are predestined. For Sartre, there is no predestination; we control our destiny through the choices we make. Oreste also feels that he could find his past in Argos. This is again an example of innocent bad faith, as we cannot acquire an essence by assuming a social role. Furthermore, he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.\n\nOreste therefore begins in a position of bad faith and moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticity with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). This transformation is symbolized by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste, her brother, and not Phil\u00e8be. What primarily influences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play. The people of Argos are deluding themselves to escape the anguish of individual freedom and responsibility. They are like objects, unchanging and determined by external forces. Their present and future is also determined by a past event\u2014alleged complicity in the murder. Even the children are brought up in guilt.\n\nIt is also Electre's behavior which helps transform Oreste. At first, she seems to refute his self-remorse and appears to be trying to get the people to see their bad faith. At the 'f\u00eate des morts', she tries to get the people to realize their freedom, but is only stopped when Jupiter, in a religious parody of the making of Jesus' tanstae, performs a miracle and moves a stone.", "speed": 0.6579658919061492, "eta": "00h09m45s"}

The account of Clamence's fall is not the retelling of an \"\u00e9venement\" but can be more accurately be described as \"un \u00e9tat de l'\u00e2me\", in which Clamance is embued with guilt and the desire to judge other people. Guilt is implicit in the account, due to the fact that it is focalized through the form of a confension, by Jean-Baptiste Clamance, an ex-parisienne lawyer, however it is also implicit in various subtilties throught the play, and alludes to the universal guilt of mankind. Clamance introduces himself as a \"juge-p\u00e9nitent\", these term is not clarfied until the end of the novel, and it demonstrates Clamance's tendency to judge people, his desire to feel superior to other people and to apportion guilt to those he encounters.\nClamence's former profession as a lawyer seems to back up this theme. It meant that he was in a milieu of guilt, since he was defending people guilty of crimes, or trying to prove people guilty of crimes. His profession gave him a feeling of superiority. In the court he often felt superior to the judge and he enjoyed the satisfaction he got from looking down on people and judging theme. Guilt and judgement are inherent in the legal system.\nIn Paris, Clamence led what he thought was a happy and satisfying lilfe. He enjoyed helping people because of the satisfaction it gave him.

In Les Justes, the violence is directed at the ruling members of 1905 Russia. Assassination attempts are carried out by members of the terrorist wing of the revolutionary party on the Grand Duke Sergei with the eventual achieved objective of killing him. Thus the political violence of Les Justes is directed in such a way at the opposition with the ultimate objective of returning the lands to the people, thereby freeing them from oppression, tyranny and most tangibly hunger.\nIn 'Les Mains Sales', the political violence is an internal affair inside the communist/socialist alliance. The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists. Hoederer wants an all party alliance with the Fascists in order to get a slight grip on power with the ultimate aim of complete power if his devious plan to undermine such a coalition government comes off.

They also however interact with each other, making the arguments of the other more credible or maybe discounting other's arguments and thus swaying the audience to one side. It can be said that this is the case in 'Caligula', it is amazing that we can have sympathy with Caligula at the end of the play after seeing his deeds - but through studying his words and the words and actions of others we can see how this is so.\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, his sister, dies. The audience is clearly able to sympathise with death and the effect of mourning - but we are confused to hear later that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him - <quote>. Shocked that it is not for his sister that he mourns but the state of the human condition, Caligula however manages to open our eyes to a 'wider' truth and we begin to find him fascinating.\nHe announces that he wants \"la lune\" - which seems rediculous to the audience, but to other characters in the play it is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help him in his search - saying <quote> - and we begin to accept this too. We see that he is searching for something out of reach, and we have sympathy knowing that the moon is impossible. Camus explores this theme in Le Mythe de Sisyphe where he says thant man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, onnes with nature, and innocence, but instead recieves lies, disorder, and a separation of man and nature ending in death not immortality - and warns <quote>.

Characters react differently to these themes, and their interactions with each other either strengthen or weaken the credibility of their arguments, eventually swaying the audience to one side. This dynamic is especially evident in 'Caligula,' where we can develop sympathy for Caligula even after witnessing his actions, thanks to a deeper understanding of his words and the actions of others.\n\nAt the beginning of the play, Drusilla, Caligula's sister, dies. The audience naturally feels sympathy for death and the effects of mourning. However, when Caligula later claims that the 'death' only revealed a 'verit\u00e9' to him, the audience becomes confused and shocked. Caligula's remarks about mourning his sister for the state of the human condition challenge the audience's understanding and open our eyes to a 'wider' truth. This revelation makes Caligula fascinating to us, despite his questionable actions.\n\nCaligula then announces his desire for \"la lune,\" which seems ridiculous to the audience. However, to other characters in the play, such as H\u00e9licon, this ambition is perfectly acceptable. H\u00e9licon agrees to help Caligula, saying, \"Il est fou, mais il est roi,\" suggesting that while Caligula's quest is absurd, it is justified because of his royal status. Through H\u00e9licon's support, we begin to accept this impossible goal. We see that Caligula is searching for something out of reach, and our sympathy for his quest stems from the impossibility of the moon.\n\nCamus explores this theme further in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe,\" where he argues that man searches for truth, understanding, clarity, oneness with nature, and innocence but instead receives lies, disorder, and a separation from nature, leading to death rather than immortality. Camus warns that the human condition is inherently absurd.

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children would then go on to Lyc\u00e9e and either to University or \"Les Grandes Ecoles\" so joining the class of the \u00e9lite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today. \nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a major concern for the later governments. Under the second and third republics not much advance was made on the education question as this did not appear to be a priority.\nUnder the forth republic reforms were proposed but because of the multi-party governments who had to face internal struggles all the time, they failed in most cases to be passed.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "To fully understand the current and recent situation of French education, it is essential to examine its historical context, which helps explain the elitism inherent in the system. We must start by looking back to the late 18th century when Napoleon formulated his views on education. Napoleon believed that education served the state's needs, rather than the rights of individuals, to ensure smooth governance. Given that most of the population was engaged in agriculture at the time, only basic primary education was deemed necessary for the majority. He left primary education largely in the hands of the church, which he thought would promote social cooperation. Secondary and higher education, however, were crucial for training professionals, and thus, were under state control. This early system already created a gap between primary and secondary education, a divide that persisted until relatively recent times, despite various attempts at reform.\n\nThis initial educational structure did not facilitate much social mobility. Children from poorer backgrounds typically left school after primary education, which provided a very basic education. In contrast, children from wealthier families continued to higher levels of education, attending lyc\u00e9es and then universities or grandes \u00e9coles, thereby joining the elite class.

After 1968, Edgar Faure tried to allow for more autonomy and less direct rule from Paris. Although the Ministry was still to be responsible for Building costs, the universities were to be allowed to divide into Unit\u00e9s d'Enseignement et de Recherche (UER) and given more freedom in chosing accademic staff. However, universities were often divided into new universities according to the political leanings of its professors, and have been held back by political squabbles. The university graduate does not enjoy the same prestigue as his European counterparts. The Universities have little contact with the outside business world and the divided nature of the UERs allows little scope for cross fertilization of disciplines.

It must also be noted before beginning the discussion of the Fifth Republic, that from 1884-1968 French Unions did not have the right to organise collectively at the workplace, they only had the right to 'social status' - as a national body. Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether.

In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to reflect the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.\nWhen the socialists came to power in 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the \"code du travail\" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1/3 of this \"Code du Travail\" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, and before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.\nTrade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had to wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given a legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes. \nThe main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership of the PCF is  a large aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conf\u00e9deration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail-force ouvri\u00e8re) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become too radical for many of its Catholic members. The CFDT is connected with the PS (Partie Socialiste) although it is the least eager to appear as acting as a back-up for politics.\nBesides these 3 groups there are many other Trade Union formations in France - their large number meaning weakness and low membership.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "All industrial relations in France are based on socialist groupings.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life.

De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power.

From 1791 to 1958, France experienced 16 constitutions and three Republics. The 4th Republic was characterized by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought de Gaulle back to power, as he was seen as the only person capable of addressing and solving the Algerian crisis. During his years in exile, de Gaulle witnessed France's humiliation following its defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime. After the war, France was still not in control of its destiny, forced to align itself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe.\" De Gaulle believed that this state of affairs was due to the undermining of the state's role and authority. Upon returning to power in 1958, de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His influence in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overstated, and while it can be said that it was tailored for him, it became increasingly so through a series of constitutional amendments and changes in political life. In drafting the text, two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favored a return to the old Bonapartist tradition, where the President would hold almost omnipotent powers. Others, fearing such a concentration of power, wished to empower the government more.

Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers.

So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.\nThe role of the president is defined in the Constitution but is rather ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an \"arbiter\". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the making of policies or does it mean he must intervene and play an active role?\nThe term 'arbiter' is sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this they did.

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the Fourth Republic's debacle, characterized by government and ministerial instability leading to a series of coalition governments with limited power due to endless compromises among its constituent elements, France needed a strong government base.

De Gaulle's actions soon clarified his supreme authority, dispelling any doubts about the distribution of power.\n\nThere are several points of contention regarding the President's functions. Firstly, Article 16 grants the President special powers during national emergencies, but it lacks criteria for defining such emergencies. In 1961, De Gaulle invoked these special powers, citing Algeria as the cause of the emergency. However, this was intensely debated at the time, with many believing that De Gaulle was abusing these powers. Secondly, the lack of clear criteria for national emergencies raised questions about the President's ability to declare such emergencies and the extent of the powers granted during these times.", "speed": 0.6579658919061492, "eta": "00h09m45s"}

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9moniale de l'Etat', a similar r\u00f4le to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It gave the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debr\u00e9, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reserv\u00e9\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian r\u00f4le of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.\nArticle 11 was not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle used it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to use Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition. It was also a good way to increase contact with the people outside of the normal methods.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Much of the ambiguity surrounding the powers of the President in the Fifth Republic arose from the compromise between 'presidentialisme' and 'parlementarism' inherent in the Constitution. The President was endowed with the traditional powers of the Head of State and was also designated as the 'chef c\u00e9r\u00e9monial de l'\u00c9tat', a role similar to that of the Queen. Additionally, the President was made the Chief of the army. Through articles 8, 12, and 11 of the Constitution, the President was granted significant power, including the ability to name and potentially dismiss the Prime Minister, without needing the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible.\n\nArticle 8 was particularly contentious, as it granted the President the power to appoint the Prime Minister but left unclear whether he also had the authority to dismiss him. This ambiguity was exploited by Charles de Gaulle, who after appointing Michel Debr\u00e9 in 1958, was compelled to withdraw his support in 1962. De Gaulle found Debr\u00e9 to be a suitable Prime Minister during wartime, but following the Algerian War, he deemed him no longer useful, effectively sacking him. De Gaulle's choice of Georges Pompidou as his successor in 1969 further emphasized the President's exclusive right to appoint the Prime Minister, establishing a 'domaine r\u00e9serv\u00e9' where the Prime Minister would not interfere. De Gaulle positioned the President as the key figure for long-term issues, particularly in foreign and defense policies, while the Prime Minister would focus on short-term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian role of the President evolved throughout the Fifth Republic. Georges Pompidou, who had served as Prime Minister for six years, continued to handle economic, domestic, and financial policies after his appointment.\n\nArticle 11, on the other hand, was less ambiguous, allowing the President to put important decisions to the people through referendums. De Gaulle utilized Article 11 in 1961 to ask the French public if they believed the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973, Pompidou employed the same article to gauge public opinion on the expansion of the European Community,", "speed": 0.6579658919061492, "eta": "00h09m45s"}

At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixi\u00e8me year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization.

The lyc\u00e9e had long been the stronghold of \u00e9litism, rooted in its Napoleonic tradition.\n\nIn 1963, Fouchet established the College d'Enseignement Secondaire, a lower secondary school intended to promote upward social mobility. Jean Capelle, a key proponent of this initiative, drew inspiration from English comprehensive schools. However, according to an article by Hain Gaziel, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The creation of three 'fili\u00e8res' (streams) essentially divided prospective lyc\u00e9e and C.E.G. students. The third stream, theoretically aimed at pushing students into the upper two streams, proved impractical in practice, with only 1% successfully transferring. It was dubbed the 'poubelle' (garbage bin) of the system. These reforms were undertaken during a period of population expansion, which demanded education of any kind, potentially compromising the quality of reforms. As a result, school pupils became disillusioned, viewing the school system as an agent of social discrimination. Lyc\u00e9es were seen as bastions for the bourgeois and cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, while the chances of children from working-class backgrounds ('ouvriers') achieving higher education remained remote. It appeared that equality of opportunity and high academic standards were incompatible in the French educational system.", "speed": 0.6579658919061492, "eta": "00h09m45s"}

Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy.\n\tIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks.\n\tThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men, a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother.\n\tVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and death. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it.\n\tCandide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair.

He wrote Candide in 1758 and published it in 1759, by which time he was 64 years old and was feeling very sceptical. Voltaire began his life mildly optimistic but by the time he reached 64 years, he came to the conclusion that the question of philosophical optimism had to be dealt with.\n\tThus, in Candide, meaning 'Optimism', he chooses to attack the doctrine of Optimism in a subtle and amusing way.

Candide, the hero is often the mouth-piece of voltaire and in this way Voltaire can express his own views through the character.\n\tThe book, 'Candide', is full of tragedies and some of the experiences endured by the characters are devastatingly shocking. However, Voltaire's aim is not to move but to amuse. he writes the tragedies in such a way that they bring laughter to the reader rather than tears. The Narrative side takes second place as Voltaire concentrates on the philosophy he is trying to put forward.\n\tIn order to tackle the question of philosophical optimism in Candide, Voltaire has to prove his philosophy of rejecting the doctrine of optimism or at least trying to slow it down. Thus, he begins the story by making Candide agree to philosophical optimism and listen to his tutor, Dr. Pangloss who preaches it. Then as the story progresses, the changes in attitudes and thoughts can develop, resulting in the way Voltaire believes.\n\tVoltaire aims to persuade the reader that the doctrine of optimism is not a valid one.

The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to the earthquake itself.\n\tIn 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it. We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. Pangloss then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\tThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. This 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is clear to all but Pangloss showing no sympathy consoles Candide by saying that it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.\n\tVoltaire is in full flow now with incident after incident which stretch the reader's credulity to the limit but also go to show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point which is outlined above when the real earthquake occured.\n\tThe plot then goes into a ridiculous level. Candide is whipped and Pangloss is hanged at a magnificant auto-da-f\u00e9 which was held so that similar earthquakes would not strike Lisbon again.

We encounter the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter, where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with basic examples, such as ears being given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. He then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\nThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss, and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor, are sailing to Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. The 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is clear to all, but Pangloss, showing no sympathy, consoles Candide by saying it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.\n\nVoltaire is in full flow now, with incident after incident that stretch the reader's credulity to the limit and show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point, as when the real earthquake occurred. The plot then goes into a ridiculous level, with Candide being whipped and Pangloss being hanged at a magnificent auto-da-f\u00e9, which was held to prevent similar earthquakes from striking Lisbon again. Candide begins a series of adventures without his tutor, first with Cacambao and then with Martin, an eternal pessimist.", "speed": 0.663168675148485, "eta": "00h08m52s"}

It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he was alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it was only when man discovered the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus found the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.\n\tRousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads to the development of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.\n\tThis is the development of man into society from a stage of equality into a life of human inequality.\n\tRousseau looks at 'man-made-man' and sees how he is dehumanised when compared with earlier man.\n\tThe social development which occurred when men desired self-improvement led to man being capable of advancement due to science and scientific knowledge but as  Rousseau said, 'these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In the \"Discours sur l'origine de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9,\" Rousseau illustrates how the advancement of civilization has compromised man's natural happiness and freedom through the creation of artificial inequalities in power, wealth, and social privilege. To uncover the origins of this corruption, Rousseau traces the development of humanity from its nascent stage to the societal structures of the eighteenth century, identifying the primary sources of human equality.\n\nRousseau envisions natural man as physically strong and self-sufficient, thriving in the woodland, uncomplicated, and with few needs, such as \"food, a mate, and rest.\" It is crucial to Rousseau's argument to view natural man as innocent, independent, and inherently good. When man was alone and depended on no one, he was equal to his fellow man. However, the discovery of the ability to cooperate with others, work together, and form the basis of a civilization marked the beginning of man's corruption, leading to social inequalities.\n\nRousseau delineates man's development into five distinct stages. The first stage is the era of man's innocence, where he is solely dependent on himself and free from corruption. The second stage sees the formation of a social unit, known as a \"family,\" as man builds a dwelling and becomes a protector and father. This period is referred to as the \"golden age,\" but it is also the era from which man is expelled due to the desire for self-improvement. This desire leads to the development of the concept of property, as man, having become a cultivator, needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others. Consequently, this leads to a state of perpetual war, as Hobbes described: \"of each against all.\" The final stage is the establishment of a \"social contract\" to ensure peace for all and to escape the constant state of war.\n\nThis narrative is the journey of man from a state of equality to a life of human inequality. Rousseau also examines the transformation of \"man-made-man,\" observing how he is dehumanized in comparison to earlier stages of human existence. The social development that arose from the desire for self-improvement allowed for advancement through science and knowledge. However, as Rousseau observed, \"these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes.\"", "speed": 0.663168675148485, "eta": "00h08m52s"}

Voltaire sets this optimism in an absurd background where it is personified by the ridiculous philosopher Pangloss. Pangloss's answer to all occurances, whether good or bad, is that 'all is for the best in the best of all worlds' it does not matter how much human misery and violence he is exposed to he still quotes his philosophy. \n\tVoltaire demonstrates the futility of this attitude in a very amusing, fast flowing way, Pangloss is merely a literary device designed to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\tVoltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences are good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westiphalia have been destroyed and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette, yet Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, there is no despair. Pangloss merely states that if it were not for syphilis there would be no chocolate in the world.

Voltaire demonstrates the futility of this optimistic view in a fast-paced and humorous manner, using Pangloss as a literary device to convey Candide's criticism of thoughtless optimism. Instead of dismantling the philosophy bit by bit, Voltaire takes the opposite approach, building it up to such ridiculous extremes that it becomes impossible to take seriously.\n\nVoltaire creates a series of events that bring about great human suffering, both naturally and through human actions, and then places Pangloss in the midst of these calamities to underscore the absurdity of his philosophy. For example, when Jacques drowns during an earthquake and shipwreck, Pangloss refuses to help Candide rescue him, arguing that these events were meant to occur for a specific purpose, including the death of Jacques in Lisbon harbor. Another instance occurs when Candide, after escaping the Bulgars, encounters his old master, Pangloss, who has lost his home and family in Westphalia and is suffering from syphilis. Despite these deplorable circumstances, Pangloss remains optimistic, stating that if it were not for syphilis, there would be no chocolate in the world.

He has been widely acclaimed as the witiest and most perceptive authour of the 'roman philosophique'. In Candide, he tells the story of the young hero's travels throughout the world in search of happiness. On his travels the na\u00efve boy becomes a mature man. Many of the episodes that the characters are put through in the story are outrageous and extravagant. They serve to keep the reader's interest and to give a cynical comentary on the world through Votaire's eyes. \n\tThe main motivation of the novel,however, was to launch an attack upon a popular philosophical theory of the day: optimism. This doctrin of divine providence carried many prestigous names in its list of followers, such as that of John Locke, a very influential English philosopher of the period. Optimism stated that, as the world was created by god, ,who is a perfect being, all that happens in it must be for the best. All individual suffering must be attributed to the general good.\n\tVoltaire's experiences and knowledge did not allow him to adopt this theory.

How could such a terrible disaster possibly be 'for the best', and how could the deaths of so many people contribute towards the general good?\n\tIn the novel, the young Candide accepted Optimism as an unshakeable theory when he was taught it by his tutor, Pangloss, whom he described as the best of all tutors.

He also believes that they are less given to outbursts of passions, which often have disastrous consequences in warmer climates.\n\nMontesquieu's \"De l'Esprit des Lois\" attempts to explain the spirit in which laws are formed. For Montesquieu, \"loi\" is synonymous with rapport or relationship. He believed that in studying societies, one must take into account the hidden structures inherent in humans, such as passions, and separate the religious and moral influences to correctly interpret the characteristics of the specific society. Montesquieu believed in the existence of a natural law that existed before the formation of societies. He thought that this natural law ensured that man had an instinct for self-preservation, was mutually attracted to other members of his species, and sought to associate himself with them (which gave rise to his vulnerability). He believed that societies in colder climates could exist without legislative law for a long time.\n\nHe characterizes people from warm climates as being given to excessive sentimentality, a code of honor, and an exaggerated type of love.", "speed": 0.663168675148485, "eta": "00h08m52s"}

The passing of the Single European Act 1986 has given the concept of an open and common market a new lease of life by adding much detail to existing provisions in the EEC Treaty. Since the Single European Act 1986 the completion of such an open common market ( ie one free market for Europe with no trade barriers) can now be seen as a reality. However, even though Britain has joined the European Communities and accepted its affects through the passing of the European Communities Act 1972, there  has arguably been a very high price paid. This of course is the loss of absolute supremacy for the English Parliament.\n\t\tThe Orthodox theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy states that Parliament cannot restrict it's own legislative omnicompetence. That is, Parliament today cannot pass laws which limit tomorrow's Parliament's legislative powers, be they restrictions on manner and form, or as in the case of the European Communities Act, restrictions on subject matter. Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law. Therefore, in the case of a contradiction between the two, European Community law must be abided by. This first aspect of Britain's membership of the European Communities has thus already shown a restriction on Britain's legal system : that of the doctrine of implied repeal. The court's view of this argument is of utmost importance; however the judges have not had to decide this point as yet. The orthodox Lord Denning has described Britain's Accession as a \"farewell to our sovreignty\" on the one hand and yet on the other hand he has said that theoretically conferred powers can be retained, even though in practice it would be virtually impossible.\n\t\tThe radical theorists would agree that it is \"farewell to our sovreignty\" completely.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\". The 1970's saw progress in integration, with the introduction of community policy instruments, which enabled greater scope for national policies.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States committed to the development of closer economic and political cooperation.

Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union. As the title implies, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in Britain towards fuller integration with Europe is the belief that it will imply a loss of sovereignty for the elected government. In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.\n\t\tThe Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.\n\t\tBritain's reputation in Europe on these issues is not an enviable one.

The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard to define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public. A great fear of losing our sovereignty has stemmed from the varying theories of what \"1992\" entails, and from many people's wish to remain ignorant of current developments.\n\t\tThe most evident implication of the single market is, in my view, the abolition of trade and customs barriers. This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is ever introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to \"buy British\", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result.

It involves the expansion of the british market into all the other markets of Europe and vice versa. One will see the disappearance of all tariff barriers and customs and this in turn will allow for the free movement within Europe.\n\t\tBritain is very apprehensive. As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The British will find it very difficult to take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called \"the Continent\" - as though it were a separate entity).\n\t\tThe obvious advantage is the far wider market open to British industry and a bigger jobs market. \nBut one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe.

It seems to have two distinct forms of which one seems to worry the British public most; Political Union, followed by Economic and Monetary Union. In fact these issues have become so heated in Great Britain at present that they have lead to many disputes within the present government. They also appear to be one of the major reasons for the resignation of Mrs. Thatcher. In losing her, have we not already lost a part of our sovereignty\u00a0? Europe is forcing change upon us as we have been attempting to stand back, \"not letting socialism in by the back door\", instead of playing an important role in positively affecting the decision making processes - or in the European Community. Great Britain cannot afford to play a minor role in a two speed Europe especially in the time of recession at present, and this has manifested itself in the top governmental disputes. So, a loss of sovereignty seems inevitable, whether we like it or not. On monetary and economic Union, I don't feel that we have much to lose; in fact on the contrary I think that we would benefit enormously, especially in the light of 1992. If only the issue were presented in a more positive light, perhaps with some modifications, I am sure that the British public would give their agreement. After all, how long is it since we lost our sovereignty to the follies of the international Stock Exchanges of New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt ? Will losing our sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference\u00a0? Did not the \"Big Bang\" in October 1987 send shock waves world wide with share prices plummeting ? World processes are continuously becomming more and more interlinked; the effects of which often see no physical borders. I therefore see this European Unity as a natural process in World development, something which should be made easier rather than hindered. Can we really afford to play for time by dragging our feet ? \n\t\tThe issue of Political Union is still more disputed. Yes, we have a Queen and what would happen to her - would she be forced to abdicate and be succeed by King Jacques Delors ?\nThis is a very typical misinformed and ignorant statement posed by certain British \"patriots\".<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The European Union (EU) is a political and economic entity that has two distinct forms: Political Union and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). These issues have become particularly contentious in the United Kingdom, leading to significant disputes within the government and, notably, contributing to the resignation of Margaret Thatcher. The loss of Thatcher, a key figure, seems to indicate a potential erosion of British sovereignty. Europe is pushing for change, while the UK has been hesitant, concerned about not allowing \"socialism in through the back door.\" Instead, the UK should actively participate in shaping the decision-making processes within the European Community. Given the current economic recession, the UK cannot afford to be a minor player in what is becoming a \"two-speed Europe.\" This has led to top governmental disagreements and suggests an inevitable loss of sovereignty, whether or not we like it.\n\nRegarding EMU, I believe there is much to gain. In fact, the potential benefits could be enormous, especially considering the experiences of 1992. If the issue were presented more positively, perhaps with some modifications, I am confident the British public would support it. After all, have we not already ceded sovereignty to the international stock exchanges of New York, Tokyo, and Frankfurt? Will losing sovereignty to Brussels or the Bundesbank make much difference? The \"Big Bang\" in October 1987 demonstrated the rapid and interconnected nature of global financial processes. Therefore, I see this European Unity as a natural part of global development, something we should facilitate rather than hinder. Can we truly afford to delay this process?\n\nThe issue of Political Union is even more contentious. There is a common, but misguided, fear that the Queen might be forced to abdicate and be succeeded by Jacques Delors. This is a typical, misinformed, and ignorant statement often made by certain British \"patriots.\" It reflects a deep-seated misunderstanding of the EU's structure and the role of the monarchy.", "speed": 0.663168675148485, "eta": "00h08m52s"}

However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States. When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America, they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity. They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force. A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that, for example in military matters, the central government spoke for all. It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states, but no-one would challenge the fact that, on matters external to the United States, the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body.\n\t\tIn Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force. However it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities (such as was seen over Europe's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute), the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place. Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty, but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament, something which no state in the United States could lawfully do.

Ever since 1066, the last time that any foreign people successfully conquered British soil, the English (and later, the \"British\") have always been the conquerors. In the early Middle Ages, around the times of Edward I, II and III, the English Kings ruled large areas of France, and later in history during the reign of Queen Victoria the British Empire came into existence. With the granting then of independance to the colonies Britain was restricting her sovereignty, for which special Acts had to be passed to enable her to do this, but Britain has always retained absolute sovereignty over our own destiny. We have always been our own people, never accepting any higher power (NB we broke away from the power of the Catholic church, and the authority of Rome in Tudor times). But now we are faced with the \"threat\" or the \"opportunity\" of Europe - the actuality of being an integral part of a greater \"being\", part of a Single Europe with the many advantages it brings, but also the disadvantages, such as the loss of sovereign power.\n\t\tAs can be shown by the development of many, if not most of the individual states, much grater things can be achieved if small communities are brought together, to pool their common resources and form a single sovereign state which common aims, target and by necessity : laws.

Later, during the reign of Queen Victoria, the British Empire emerged, further solidifying the notion of British dominance and sovereignty. Even with the granting of independence to the colonies, Britain retained absolute sovereignty over its own destiny, as special Acts had to be passed to enable this.

First of all trade treaties were brought into existence between various countries. This culminated into the signing of the EEC treaty in Rome and which over the years has attracted an increasing number of members. At the present day there are 12 members. In the future this number will perhaps expand due to the events in Eastern Europe, whereby more countries are turning towards a market economy.Negotiations have been intensive over the years between the various members, especially over the actual basis of the union and over how much power should be given to the European Communities'Institutions, which have been set up. These include the Council of Ministers, made up by various minister of the memberstates, the Commission, the European Parliament made up by MEP's, who are democratically elected from memberstates and the European court of Justice. The           for the European Community will be the year 1992 when the internal market will be completed and trade barriers lifted and there will be common policies on social level.\n\tThis closer union has also led to concern though. People are questioning whether this will lead to a loss of sovereignty for the memberstates. First of all what is sovereignty. Sovereignty means a state has territorial integrity, people and government, which is recognised by other countries in the world. This government makes and exercises policies without interference from any other country on all areas, economic, domestic and foreign policies. It is obvious that the memberstates of the European Community's sovereignty is still intact. Countries are still making independent decisions. But European law, decided by Council and European Parliament does in some cases preside over national law, and is made to apply throughout Europe, especially concerning social matters. This will be necessary if there is to be an internal market in 1992. Concerning some matters the same laws will have to apply throughout Europe to make this market effective. Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable. On the other hand when it comes to vital issues, for example defense and the economy and the actual running of the country it is still the national governments that decide.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "After the devastations of the second World War, closer cooperation has existed among European States on all levels.

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.

As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - that is without the interference of Parliament.

After researching various sources on new age ideas and their teachings, I have concluded that the case against teaching new age beliefs is stronger than the case for it, primarily due to its arguments of values, consequences, and the use of mainstream sources and hard facts.\n\nIt is quite challenging for any author to even make a case supporting the teaching of new age ideas, given that there is no precise definition of what constitutes \"new age.\" One magazine opposing the teaching of new age beliefs stated that it was indeed difficult to define, but identified four main themes that best tied most new age individuals together:", "speed": 0.6970577965787946, "eta": "00h07m40s"}

Steroids and the use of other performance enhancing\ndrugs are becoming a major problem in today's society. Steroids are\nchemical cousins of the hormone testosterone.

There are two sides to this issue. On one side are chemists\narmed with state\u001eof\u001ethe\u001eart equipment for detecting the use of such\nsubstances. On the other are many athletes determined to use any means\navailable to enhance their performance and get away with it. Drug\ntesting of all athletes is ethical and should be mandatory at any given\ntime to ensure fair competition, protect athletes' health and safety\nfrom the long term effects of steroid usage and prevent drug usage among\nstudent and professional athletes who are regarded as role models.\nMany people question whether mandatory drug testing is ethical or if it\nis a violation of athletes rights to privacy. Ethics refers to human\nconduct with emphasis on the determination of right and wrong.

Some people would go too far. Steroids and the use of other performance-enhancing drugs have become a major problem in today's society. Steroids are chemical cousins of the hormone testosterone, promoting muscle growth and increasing aggression, spurring athletes to more strenuous workouts. The International Olympic Committee has already banned nearly 100 substances. There are two sides to this issue. On one side are chemists armed with state-of-the-art equipment for detecting such substances. On the other are many athletes determined to use any means available to enhance their performance and get away with it.\n\nDrug testing of all athletes is ethical and should be mandatory at any given time to ensure fair competition, protect athletes' health and safety from the long-term effects of steroid usage, and prevent drug usage among student and professional athletes who are regarded as role models. Many people question whether mandatory drug testing is ethical or if it is a violation of athletes' rights to privacy. Ethics refers to human conduct with emphasis on the determination of right and wrong. Using performance-enhancing drugs is against the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association and professional sports associations.

Another, is the right of freedom of speech. The third reason\nis to decrease the new rise in violent crime, divorce and teenage\npregnancies.

It's true that it\ncan be transmitted in a variety of ways, but none of these involve\ncasual contact.

Despite the very specific\ninstances in which a person can contract AIDS, many people are being\ndiscriminated against in the job market, in trying to receive health\ncare, and in applying for, or maintaining insurance coverage because\nthey have AIDS. We as a society need to start viewing these people as\nvictims of a deadly, and fatal disease, rather than as criminals, or\noutcasts of society. It is morally and legally wrong for people with\nHIV, or AIDS to be discriminated against by employers and insurance\ncompanies simply on the basis that they are afflicted with the disease.\nOne can conclude from the evidence that will be shown here that this\nkind of discrimination is happening, and that it is in fact wrong, both\nlegally and morally. The opposition offers a weak argument that the\nrights of employers and insurance companies should be paramount to the\nrights of people who are afflicted with AIDS, when it comes to deciding\nwho and who not to hire, or who and who not to insure.

While these concerns are valid, the reality is that many children live in homes that are either financially unstable or abusive. These children often do not receive the warm and nurturing care they need, which can have lifelong consequences. Moreover, there are too many individuals taking advantage of the system by having children solely for financial gain. However, many children have shown that growing up in an orphanage can provide a stable and nurturing environment.

These considerations are crucial when deciding what makes our life important to us.\n\nIf we have defined life, then we must define death. Throughout history, the focus has been on breathing, then the heartbeat, and later, the lack of brain activity became the distinction between life and death. The brain and its connection to the senses, speech, understanding, and reasoning are integral parts of life. Death could be defined as the loss of these important aspects connected to our determination of life. Where do you draw the line between life and death? To determine this question, we have to consider our definition of life and our definition of death. I have heard of people who want to be put on life support in the hopes that a cure or treatment for their ailment will be discovered. For these people, life is precious at any cost, and the cost here is more than just money. Consider the price of emotions as well, to ourselves and to people whose lives we have touched.", "speed": 0.6692949162385823, "eta": "00h07m11s"}

This is entirely\nethical and in most cases necessary to continue to have many of the\nprograms and facilities that the universities offer. To accomplish this,\nmany universities add courses and provide new things such as research\nlabs and new cutting edge equipment. Many universities even try to\naccommodate the changing needs of the students by providing services\nsuch as free tutors and bigger staffs.\nBut not once before have I heard of a university trying to attract\nstudents with grass, trees, and a fountain. To be exact, about five city\nblocks of it, none the least. That's right, our very own Marquette\nUniversity is trying what in my opinion is one of the most unethical\nideas to attract students since UCLA added classes to attend to\ndifferent racial histories and so\u001ecalled physcological differences. This\ngreen space is supposed to create a more comfortable learning\nenvironment, but might just reverse this comfort when students see the\ncost of just under five blocks of grass. It's a whopping ten million\ndollars that the students, not the gesus, are going to pay. Even if they\ndivvy it up over twenty or so years, many students can't afford this\nincrease. I myself am barely scraping by. Plus this grass will cost\nlocals a matching ten million dollars just to reroute all of the\nutilities that run through Wisconsin Avenue.\nSome of the utilities effected by the common's project will be local\nbuses. If many of you noticed, about three to five routes come through\nMarquette's planned commons and that just might cause problems. The\ntransit company is estimating to lose between \"$1 million and $600,000,\"\nwhich the university is trying to offset by getting students on the U\u001e\npass system. The University of Milwaukee is one of the users of this\nsystem. I feel that this won't help, considering that a large number of\nstudents that already use the county transit and contribute to the\nprofits of the county's transit.

Marquette University is currently proposing such a green space, which in my opinion is one of the most unethical ideas to attract students since UCLA introduced classes to address different racial histories and so-called psychological differences. While the university claims this green space will create a more comfortable learning environment, it might do the opposite when students see the cost of maintaining nearly five blocks of grass. The project is estimated to cost ten million dollars, which the students, not the university, will ultimately pay. Even if this cost is spread over twenty years, many students cannot afford it. I, for one, am barely managing financially. Moreover, the project will also cost locals an additional ten million dollars to reroute utilities running through Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nSome of the utilities affected by the project include local bus routes, which currently serve about three to five Marquette University routes. The transit company estimates a potential loss of between $1 million and $600,000. Marquette University plans to offset this by encouraging students to use the U-Pass system. However, the University of Milwaukee is already a user of this system, and I believe it won't help. Many students who already rely on the county transit system contribute to its profits, and I think the city might lose more money overall, rather than less, as Marquette anticipates.", "speed": 0.6692949162385823, "eta": "00h07m11s"}

Proponents of euthanasia argue that\nthe Declaration of Independence states life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness as rights that all American possess. Opponents of euthanasia\npresent the questions, \"does the right to your own life include the\nright to take that life as well?\" In my opinion, that should not be so.\nSimply because that there are few people who are thinking of taking\nthere own lives and are also of sane mind. If someone is having a bad\nenough struggle within themselves that they are willing to end that God\u001e\ngiven life, then it is possible that the individual is not mentally or\nemotionally stable to make that decision. So, who is to decide whether a\nlife is worth living? Who can project whether a patient in a coma will\ncome to consciousness or not? With questions such as these, there is no\nblack or white answers. There is a large gray area involved in answering\nthose questions that the law is supposed to cover. Within this paper it\nwill be shown that there are three ideas working against the practice of\neuthanasia. For one, America is not ready to allow any human being to\ntake an innocent, and in some cases a guilty individual from this world,\nwhether it be his/her own or another. The second idea is that it is too\ndifficult to determine if a person will suffer too much in his or her\nlifetime to go on living. This idea is held together by the fact that\nthere is too much gray areas within ethics and that patients or doctors\ncan not decisively determine whether a live is worth living. The third\nidea is that the \"law\" that determines whether a life is \"worth living\"\nis too vague and allows for too many shaky judgments to be made. Because\nof these reasons, euthanasia should not be allowed to be practiced as\nfreely as it is in the United States.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Although euthanasia is practiced throughout the U.S., it remains a highly controversial topic. Proponents argue that the Declaration of Independence asserts life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as fundamental rights.

Typically, individuals considering suicide are often in a state of mental or emotional instability. If someone is contemplating ending their God-given life, they might not be mentally or emotionally fit to make such a decision. So, who is to decide whether a life is worth living? Who can predict if a patient in a coma will regain consciousness? These questions highlight the complex nature of the issue, with no clear-cut answers. Within this paper, it will be shown that there are three main reasons against the practice of euthanasia. First, America is not yet ready to permit any human to end the life of an innocent, or even a guilty individual, whether it be someone's own or another. Second, it is extremely challenging to determine if a person will suffer too much to continue living. This idea is supported by the fact that there are significant gray areas in ethics, making it difficult for patients or doctors to definitively determine whether a life is worth living. Third, the law that determines whether a life is \"worth living\" is often too vague, leading to numerous uncertain judgments.

Suicide means the end of all problems (Though those problems\nare usually solved easily.) This topic has many sides but can be\nanalyzed with two: those who advocate rational suicide and those who\noppose it. To analyze specific values and consequences, I will only\ndiscuss the opponents of suicide. There are a vast number of reasons\nagainst attempting suicide. In one way or another, people seem to\njustify them all. People often discuss how selfish a suicide can be.\nOthers discuss the grief\u001estricken family. They feel no pity for the\nperson who committed suicide either. Yet, others speak of the\ninvolvement of religion in the lives of those that attempt and commit\nsuicide. The opponents of suicide often neglect to prove their\nstatements. All the statements that people make are good statements\nthat, with some thought, can be rationalized. The opponents simply fail\nto provide the evidence for the rationalization of their arguments.\nThe authors of the first argument fail to prove it. The argument of the\nselfishness of suicide is weak with hardly any evidence of its claim.\nThough, if the readers analyze their own experiences with those that\nattempt suicide, they can view this argument as a good one. In The Case\nAgainst Suicide, William Rauscher talks of suicide as an act that\nrequires only one word: selfish. He does not feel that there is any\nsuicide that can be considered rational because all suicide fails to\nthink about the effects of a suicide on others. He states that <*>. Mr\nRauscher hopes to convey that the only thing that people who commit\nsuicide do is think about whether they should end their own pains. Yet,\nRauscher fails to analyze his opposition. He should ask what does the\nperson attempting suicide thinking? The person may be thinking about his\nfamily and friends when he or she attempts suicide. For example, someone\ndying of lung cancer may make his or her family more upset if he or she\nwere alive. The pain experienced by someone dying of cancer is enormous.\nMaybe Mr Rauscher does not think about what the sight of that pain and\nthe family's helplessness in comforting the person does to their\nemotions.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Many events in our lives have consequences, but none as drastic as suicide. Suicide means the end of all problems, though those problems are usually solved easily. This topic has many sides, but it can be analyzed through the perspectives of those who advocate for rational suicide and those who oppose it. For this essay, I will focus on the opponents of suicide and the various reasons they provide against it.\n\nThere are numerous reasons against attempting suicide, and people justify them in various ways. One common justification is that suicide is selfish. Another is the grief that the suicide will cause the family. Additionally, opponents often cite the role of religion in discouraging suicide. However, the opponents of suicide often fail to provide substantial evidence to support their arguments. Instead, all the statements made can be rationalized with some thought. The authors of the first argument, in particular, fail to substantiate their claims. For example, the argument that suicide is selfish is weak, lacking concrete evidence to support its claim. However, if readers analyze their own experiences with those who attempt suicide, they might view this argument more favorably.\n\nIn \"The Case Against Suicide,\" William Rauscher argues that suicide is an act of selfishness, as it fails to consider the impact on others. He claims that all suicides are irrational because the individuals only think about their own pain. Rauscher states that the only consideration in a suicide is whether the individual should end their own suffering. However, Rauscher fails to analyze his own position carefully. For instance, a person dying of lung cancer might cause more distress to their family if they were alive, as the pain and helplessness would continue. In such cases, the person might be thinking about the well-being of their loved ones. Rauscher should consider the emotional impact on the family and how the sight of their loved one suffering might affect them.", "speed": 0.6692949162385823, "eta": "00h07m11s"}

All the things they did not have enough money to buy before, they could have now. This went on for about a year. The one day they saw their father's/husband's picture on the news. Right after, they received a call that informed them that their father had been arrested and he was in jail. All their dreams had been destroyed, and the bread winner of the family could no longer support them. They were surprised to hear on the news what kinds of things he had been involved in and they did not want to beleive any of it. The news told a story of a greedy business man who took money from elderly couples, who thought they were investing in a good real-estate project.

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers.

Although most Americans would likely profess to this belief, the real issue in a discussion of relative contribution to society involves deeper cultural assumptions about the value of different societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work provides a good example for this point. Americans value children, spending time, money, and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a perennial subject of media debate.

Women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job. Gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home. Now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to. A lot of what has changed women's roles is the feminists. These are groups of people that have defended women over the years.\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do. The problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women. Some women were happy with old traditions, some wanted a bit more in their lives, some wanted a lot more in their lives. What happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules. This makes it hard, because if they don't, they are looked down upon by their piers. An example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war. Feminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on. They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight. I felt that these people were crazy. Women just can't fight in a war very well. The are not strong enough and if captured could be raped. They feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones. Other women, though, are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does.\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair. Also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits. Many women believe that they are the victims.

The issue is that these feminist rules often apply to all women, making it difficult for those who don't conform. If they deviate from these rules, they may face social ostracism from their peers. For example, during the Iraq War, some military women wanted to serve in combat positions. Feminists vehemently argued for women's inclusion, feeling they should have been given the opportunity to fight. I, however, felt that this was impractical. Women, simply put, are not physically equipped to fight in wars, and if captured, they could be subjected to rape. On the other hand, many other women were satisfied with the status quo, where women are not allowed to serve in combat roles.\n\nFeminists have also raised concerns about unfair promotions in the workplace and the prevalence of sexual harassment, leading to numerous lawsuits.

Well simply because I was always told that whatever you do in the dark eventually comes to the light. A person that committs a crime will probably reap the benefits of whatever it is that they have done, for example, if I robbed a bank for about a cool million immediately afterwards I would probably feel really good, really financially stable and that if I got away with that then I could probably do something a little more complex or even dangerous for that matter.

I feel that chivalry is nearly dead because of the feminists in this country (USA). Men are confused whether to open a door for someone, pay for their dinner, or even touch their opposite-sexed dinner date, for fear of rejection and the \"I'd rather do it myself\" attitude. From personal experience, I have experienced dating in the 60's and dating in the 1990's. Believe me, things are much different now (1990's) than they were in the 1960's. Men were gentlemen in the 60's, felt that the woman was someone special and usually these men had parents with values that taught their children the proper traditional techniques on how someone should (and should not) act on a date. While I think that there are always exceptions to this rule, whether you are in the 60's or the 90's, however, the overall general attitude of men towards women was one of appreciation, respect, and wanting to 'find the right girl to marry'.\nNow, after 30 years of a full-blown feminist movement, some of the causes that these feminist groups stand for are noble - such as equal pay for equal work, allowing the 'glass ceiling' (i.e., mostly male managers and CEOs at the top) to be broken through more than it used to be in the 60's, and not looking down on females as the 'Miss Susie Homemaker', while chastising these women for wanting careers outside the home. \nNowadays, it takes two incomes to run a household; however, my point is that it's nice now that women have the choice of working or not working AND not have the stigmatism that they are bad people for not staying home to cook, clean, and take care of the children. (The drawback to that is that 'someone' must do it when he/she comes home from a day's work; and I do feel that the husband and wife together should share those duties when both are gainfully employed. If possible, hire a housekeeper to maintain things, which would leave more time to be spent with the children (if applicable), or more time to be spent with each other).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I have been living and observing this continent for over 40 years, and while I support some of the causes that women are promoting, I disagree with much of what is being advocated.

To me, an unorganized criminal must be very good and have considered all aspects of what they are doing in order not to get caught. The types of crimes these individuals commit are things like: robbery, assault, rape, and theft. More or less, these are petty offenses because they do not hold a high dollar value. These people are usually somewhat less educated and believe what they do is essential for survival. I cannot comment on whether there is a valid reason for committing a crime or not, but I do know that life for some people is very difficult and unless someone can really feel and understand what others go through, they have no room to judge. This type of crime very rarely pays, because the criminals just are not that good. People tell others what they did and soon the word is out. There are - in many cases - witnesses to the acts.

What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history of the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity.

Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment in society. The ideas behind \"feminism\" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights to the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life.

People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences. This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary. This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.\nSince its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion. Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were noticed and ridiculed, thus defeating their cause, because of their aggressive action. At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was therfore, detrimental to the good of society.\nAlthough \"radicals\" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards, the problem still exists. From the very beginning the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle. However, I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement, but rather, in the perception of those observing the movement. \nWhen Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. Immediately, the focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself. Those outside the movement could only see the differences between \"normality\" and Women's Lib.\nThis is still true twenty-five years later. Women supporting equal pay for women and and other \"liberal\" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s. The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals.\nSo what am I getting at? Only that so-called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women's movement.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Whenever a movement is initiated, whether it be political, religious, or artistic, stereotypes are quickly formed.

Early radicals like Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were notably ridiculed and defeated due to their aggressive actions. Meanwhile, other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were largely ignored during their lifetimes, only receiving recognition posthumously. This oversight made it appear that the feminist movement was led solely by radical and disgruntled individuals, which was detrimental to society's perception.\n\nAlthough figures like Sand and Anthony may seem mild and outdated by modern standards, the underlying issue persists. From the start, the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a seemingly losing battle. However, I argue that the blame does not lie with the radical members of the movement but rather with the perception of those observing it.\n\nWhen the Women's Movement resurged in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. The focus immediately shifted to radicals like Betty Friedan, instead of the ordinary women who returned to college and pursued careers. Outsiders could only see the stark differences between \"normality\" and the movement's radical elements.\n\nThis perception has persisted for over two decades. Women advocating for equal pay and other \"liberal\" causes like affirmative action are still seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s.

Because I myself am American, I will begin with what impact the cause has had on American culture.\n\nThis year our nation celebrates the anniversary of the Women's Suffrage Movement which resulted in the women of America being recognized as full citizens of America and thereby equal in stature to the men of America regarding voting rights. We hear the word \"battle\" used often when we read of the suffragates, those women who sought out their equality, labored for years to gain access to the political system, and finally won the right only after the power structure of American politics (a male-only bastion) heard their battle cries and acknowledged their determination to achieve equal status. No one today would say that women are not equal to men in the voting booths of America.\n\nDoes this \"battle\" continue? Those women who believe in equal opportunity, equal recognition, equal pay, and equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender certainly would say so. Undoubtedly, there are still those among us, both male and female, who resent women who have spoken out. Names like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinam, women who made their mark as feminists of the '60s, are greeted with cheers or jeers from any crowd.

Many criminals live far better than the average American because they have chosen a life of crime.

In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement. However the criminal can retire a lot faster than the worker if they (the criminal) have managed to save portions of the dollars they have stolen over the years. If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00.

Although the number of suicides by adolescents in recent years are phenomenal, the attempts are even more phenomenal. The suicide attempt rates for people under the age of 19 jumped from 50:1 in 1964 to 312:1 in 1984 <R>.

These works and studies has looked at this issue from many different angles. Some researchers have just looked at statistical data ;while, others have focused on how to recognize and prevent the suicide from happening.

Humanity witnessed one of histories [recorded history] most incredible minds at work when Albert Einstien came onto the scene. Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity.

It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered.

Clearly, of the inventions of this century, the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television. This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room, making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible. However, the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time;  one has only to turn it on to tune out reality.\n\tTelevision has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers, such as educational programming for children, cultural programs about far away places, and a closer look at current events than cannot be given by newspaper. Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production, giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully. However, this is not the way in which television has influenced society. On the contrary, television has become the escape route of the masses, a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture, rather than confront them and try to understand them. \n\tIn the minds of most Americans, television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool, as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge.

Unfortunately this still occurs, but with increasing medical & technological advances starting at the middle of the century many people have been rescued from the torment of disease.  Perhaps the greatest invention and discovery is the polio vaccine, invented by Salk, which changed the future, and future's children. The effects of such a vaccine are countless and inequivalent to any other invention of the 20th century. Why was it so great?  It changed the population  and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.\n\t For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease. Thanks to Dr. Salk we are a little bit more protected than we would have been before, living in a world of uncertainty.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "For centuries, millions of people were left dead or permanently maimed due to diseases.

Air transportation allows people to travel from place to place more quickly & efficeintly & overseas travel has been drastically effected. Without the airplane my trip from the U.S. to Spain would've taken an extraordinary amount of time, maybe a week. The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too.

Though advances in communication, transportation, and information sharing, the world as a body of people living in close proximity, has rapidly shrunk.  In the second of the world wars, the race was on to create the most devastating, most powerful, and most frightening weapon our people had ever known.

Perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear, cold war age.  In a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues, my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing, improvement, and implementation.

This discovery of AIDS has changed how people think, live, and view mortality.  At first, AIDS was thought to be a predominantly homosexual disease.  Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.  Everyone was in a panic that their children would get AIDS simply from being around Ryan.  Thus began the campaign to educate the public on how one contracts AIDS.  It was seen everywhere (and still is)- on t.v., magazines, radio, & in the schools.  Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.  Right now, more important than a cure, is the acceptance of AIDS victims & the education of the public.  It's too bad that it takes a superstar like Magic Johnson to contract AIDS & grab the attention of the public.  Even if a cure is never found.

A system that seemed to work, many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio or a newspaper where they could get the day's information easily and completely. And, in the case of the radio, information was almost immediate. Descriptions of sporting events, voices acting out stories, and the direct speech of government officials\u2014all these were brought directly into the homes of people across the nation. The radio seemed the perfect solution for countries with citizens living at all ends of its borders.\n\nThe advent of the television changed all of that, however, giving the public a visual experience that radio couldn't provide. Along with the news and information that the radio brought to homes around the world, the television added images\u2014pictures that enhanced the entire absorption of what was being broadcast. Where once a reporter's voice described a scene, now the people could see for themselves what was happening because, for the most part, it was happening in front of their eyes.\n\nBesides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewers, the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the world together. A president of one country can be seen and heard in a faraway country, giving his views and ideas so that all can understand him. The small-town store owner can watch her son in an Olympic race as it's happening without spending thousands to travel to see him in person. The examples are endless.\n\nThe television's strength must be realized, however, as it does have the power to reach so many and persuade so many more. It is a multimillion-dollar business that has developed into even more facets of media, becoming a significant part of our lives.", "speed": 0.6935287976043988, "eta": "00h05m24s"}

Some have had a great impact, while others have not. The computer however in this, the information age, has had a great impact on how society and especially business gathers, creates, responds to and, understands everyday information.\n\tThe computer has been around since the end of the Second World War. It was mainly used though, by corporations and government to process the huge amounts of information that they needed to gather. At that time the ordinary everyday person had no need to process information as we do today. As the world got more complex and people started to process and receive information that was much more sophisticated, they needed a tool in order to help them with it. No longer was a secretary and a typewriter enough to handle the ever increasing needs that technology and business put upon society.\n\tIn 1980 IBM Corporation started a revolution that today continues full force to dominate our everyday lives;  the invention of the personal computer. What the PC (personal computer) meant for society was an affordable tool that would help one sort out, save, delete or add and receive information in one's own home. This made it possible to write papers, look over databases, do your taxes and expense accounts, just about anything that you had to do. It was a way to organize your work and the information that you had to process in an easier fashion and much more quickly. Since 1980 there have been many advances in the technology that was first made available because of this machine. They got faster, more sophisticated, more programs were made available, and they soon became more compatible with other technologies. What this meant was that you now had a faster tool that could do more, receive more, and analyze more information than ever before. Today you can sit in your home at the terminal and create just about any form of document that you wish. You can use it to do just about any task you need it for. Also with the use of Modem you can tap into information sources through the phone on the other computers. You can, with a modem and a computer, recieve and process all types of information that you might need.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There have been many inventions in the 20th century that have changed our everyday lives.

In fact, all improvements in communication have had a profound effect upon the way in which people live their lives.  If I were to choose the most frequently used and influential invention of the field, it would have to be the television.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.

This establishment of gender identity should begin at the earliest age possible.  Masters and Johnson say children begin to recognize gender roles by age three. (548) Children should be taught that there is a core of behavior that makes them boys or girls but, there are other types of behavior that is open to change.  The message children are given now is a stereotype that has been the root of many problems they encounter later in life.  Men and women today need to understand and respect the fact that they are different.  They communicate in different styles.  This difference is what makes life exciting.  Gender roles, like relationships, must remain dynamic.  People must know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.\nTo achieve a well adjusted, gender relazed, adulthood society must ammend the method and the message we are giving our children.  Katha Pollit does an excellent job of illustrating how television, one of the more influential sources for children, is giving kids a skewed start in shaping their ideas of what's important in being a boy or a girl.  In her essay \"The Smurfette Principle\", she cites. many painful examples of how little ones receive a terribly distorted picture of gender roles.  Although the method takes on many forms, the message is the same <*>.\n \tPollit pints out that even the more enlightened Public Broadca stations engage in male gender bias.\nStarting girls into life's roller coaster ride with the idea that boys lives are more important than their's is a tremendous disadvantage.  It's a bad message delivered at a bad time through a bad medium.  Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur.  Parents allow their kids to watch these cartoons for two reasons; first, because they watched them when they were kids and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet.  It is important to note that these bad signals have an adverse effect on boys as well as girls.  Pollit contends:that the message is more straight forward for the boys. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In a constantly changing world, it is crucial for both genders to have a clear understanding of what it means to be a man or a woman.

Therefore, children should be taught that there is a core set of behaviors that defines them as boys or girls, but other behaviors are open to change. The current messages given to children often perpetuate stereotypes that have caused numerous problems in their later lives.

People must know and be comfortable with who they are before they can pursue a meaningful career, relationship, or anything else that matters.\n\nTo achieve a well-adjusted, gender-relaxed adulthood, society must amend the methods and messages we are imparting to our children. Katha Pollit does an excellent job illustrating how television, one of the more influential sources for children, is providing kids with a skewed view of what it means to be a boy or a girl. In her essay \"The Smurfette Principle,\" Pollit cites many painful examples of how little ones receive a terribly distorted picture of gender roles. Although the method takes on various forms, the message is consistent.\n\nPollit points out that even the more enlightened public broadcasting stations engage in male gender bias. Starting girls on life's journey with the idea that boys' lives are more important than theirs is a significant disadvantage. This bad message is delivered through a problematic medium at a critical time in their development. Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons, as Pollit cites, where the most egregious errors occur. Parents do this for two reasons: first, because they watched them when they were kids, and second, because parents are not interested in justice; they just want quiet.\n\nIt is important to note that these negative signals have an adverse effect on both boys and girls. Pollit contends that the message is more straightforward for boys. Boys are often led to believe that their lives and experiences are more important and valued, which can perpetuate a cycle of inequality and misunderstanding.", "speed": 0.6524564858067701, "eta": "00h04m55s"}

With all of the rules and regulations it has makes it hard for one to mature in such an environment. It often feels as if there are eyes watching over you at all times.

I won't say grow up or become an adult, because those are qualifications that you deal with on your own. The halls have a rule for everything you do. One major rule is the visitation policy. Most policies restrict visitors of the opposite sex in the buildings where students live. If there is no visitation at all, guest of the opposite sex have to be out of the rooms at certain time. For example, the policy at some University of South Carolina dorms state that guest of the opposite sex can be in your room from ten o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the morning. With such a restrictive policy, several resident halls act as governing parents. I thought that when you go away to college you leave your parents at home. For the amount of money spent to live on campus, students should be able to live as they wanted to. I know you think that the time in the example seems like a long time, but why\nshould the student be restricted?

Some people are very relieved and others are very shocked that Susan Smith did not recieve the death penalty. The news media and many individuals have stated facts as well as opinions, I would like to express my opinion on the justness of the sentence handed down to Susan Smith.\nSusan Smith has had a very disturbing life as a child. Her parents divorced and when she was six years old her father committed suicide. She attempted suicide at least once as a teenager. At the age of fifteen years old her stepfather molested her and continued to sleep with her after she was married. Also while she was married she had an affair with the son of her boss. She obviously cared deeply for this boyfriend and was extremely distressed when he dumped her. Her boyfriend dumped her and gave her the reason that there were things in her life that did not suit him and they should end their relationship. \n       It is obvious to me that Susan Smith's behavior in marriage was not endowed with logical mental coherence nor did she have good parental models to follow. Smith assumed that the boys were the reason the affair ended. A psychiatrist told the jury that Susan Smith had a long history of depression that led to her inability to make rational choices. If she had been thinking rationally as a mother she would have given her husband custody of her children. These past behavior patterns are a few reasons why the Supreme Court did not impose the death penalty. Instead of sentencing Susan Smith to death, they sentenced her to life in prision.\nI think that the jury made the right decision by not giving Susan Smith the death penalty. Death would have been quick, easy, and more economical. Susan Smith is now living with a guilty conscience, a sentence that is far greater than death. She will have to live knowing that she is the reason her two sons, Michael and Alex Smith are gone forever.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In 1994, Susan Smith, a mother from Union, South Carolina, chose to end the lives of her two young sons by loading them into her car and driving it into a nearby lake.

Teachers who really get into their work by going an extra mile to help students in need, should be rewarded, even if it's by a simple phrase such as thank you for a job well done. These teachers really care and.try to work with their students. I had a teacher in high school who would stay after school for as long as a student needed her to help him with something unclear. High school teachers deserve the most recognition because students in high school seem to be the hardest to deal with in a classroom.\n\tTeachers should be appreciated because they make a difference in almost every child's life. I know that my favorite teacher from high school made a difference in my life. She was more like my mother at school than a teacher. If I needed something, such as a safety pin or advice, I could depend on her for whatever I needed. Teachers seem to have a mother instinct even if they are not real mothers. Teachers leave their homes to come and educate the children of others. They too deserve their flowers while they live just as many moms ask of their children. I've heard that if you ask a child who they admire, many answer with the name of a teacher.\nFor as long as I can remember, people have been rewarded when they do good, so why aren't teachers rewarded when they do good? People don't realize the good that teachers do.\nTeachers continue to educate even when students don't want to learn. Teaching is not only their job, it becomes their responsibility. The reward can be big or small. A material gift or a kind word of expression. The type of reward isn't as important as the fact of giving the reward because teachers deserve it.\n\tAfter going to school for twelve years, I've found that I respected my high school teachers more than I did any teacher before high school.

There are many reasons why there should be a salary cap. For one, most of the professional football players make more money than a college graduate does. Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich. There is no person on Earth that could possibly use the amount of money that these players make a year, in a lifetime.

For many reasons, the answer is no. A student can graduate from college, even earning a doctorate, and still not be as recognized or compensated as a professional football player. Although a football player might be widely known, what is the true significance of their role? Doctors and nurses work tirelessly for over forty hours a week, saving lives, yet they do not receive the same recognition as professional football players. A football player can achieve more fame and honor in a single year than a necessary and rewarding profession. In many ways, this is unjust.

I can't remember a time when I have turned on the television and not watched a movie, with a great deal of sex in it.

The most common time for a child to watch a program that should be screened from them is when dad is at work and mom is in the kitchen cooking or cleaning. Children starting at age four, generally watch what looks interesting to them. Children like to watch what they call 11 Big people shows\". Those kinds of shows not only interest the children but make the children to want to experiment and do what the people on the shows do. Watching \"Big people shows\" makes the child feel older and grown up. Parents are too busy in the nineties providing for their family, cooking, cleaning, and socializing to know what their child is watching on television all of the time. Also, most children have televisions of their own at young ages and that gives them more freedom to watch what they want in the privacy of their bedroom while momls cooking or cleaning. This brings us to one major problem. Approximately ninety eight percent of television programs are not for children. That only leaves a small two percent of television programs for children to watch. If you spread that out in a seven day period that's about two programs a day. Let us start when a child gets home from school at\nout three o'clock. On one channel at three o'clock a soap opera is on which has sex, violence, and profanity. At four o'clock Opra talk show is on which has sex and profanity usually. At five o'clock Ricki Lake talk show is on which has sex and profanity. After her show we have the News a game show and then a nigh time soap opera. By this time it's nine o'clock and time for the child to go to bed and out of six hours there was one thirty minute game show that is fit for a child to watch. With these television programs on every day the child starts to watch his or her favorite show and once interested then wants to experiment. Children from ages four to twelve have not been educated about sexuality to understand what they are watching on television.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When people sit down to watch a television program that includes sex, they often do not realize that a child could be watching the same program.

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering.

Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

It stems back from the past when were strictly in the home and the man was the breadwinner and head of the household.\nPeople of an older generation are the main ones who experienced the start of the feminism movement, which was a movement for the equality of warm. Back in the early nineteen hundreds, we had only one place in society, under man's dominant rule. There was no equality between the sexes. Since, the man was the head of the household, he served as the dominant ruler and leader which is the way it always was in the past. Things were fine and dandy until women started getting a little \"uppity\" in their thinking. Women ,actually thought that they were equal to men, now what kind of idea was that? At least, that was the general concept in male society.\nThe Bible says that God made Adam, the man, before he made Eve, the woman. Therefore, since the man was first, he is the leader. This is why early society placed women under men. In the eyes of men, women were seen as, docile, fragile, and emotional human beings. So, they would treat women like pets. All a woman had to do was be there, raise the children, obey her husband's every word and she would be taken cared of with no worries to bother her \"fickle\" mind.\nWomen were getting restless, they no longer wanted to be only in the home, but they wanted real, equal places in society. Women wanted the freedom that men had to hold job positions of any type, to wear what they wanted, and most of all women wanted the right to vote. Men felt that belonged in the home, and a man was the one to go out and work and provide for his family. This was tradition. That was one of the main reasons why men had such a hard tire trying to understand why wanted to break this custom. A concept in feminism is that females are human beings too and just because they are female, doesn't mean they are particulary weak or unintelligent. Women were blessed with brains just like men were and sex discrimination is wrong.\nBeing that were believed to be the weaker sex, men set up double standards in society.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Society has a double standard for women, rooted in the past when women were strictly confined to the home and men were the breadwinners and heads of households. This tradition was particularly prevalent among older generations who experienced the early stages of the feminist movement, which aimed to achieve the equality of women. In the early 1900s, women had limited roles in society, subjugated under men's dominant rule. Men served as the primary leaders and decision-makers, a role that had persisted for centuries. The women's movement challenged this status quo, as women began to assert that they deserved equality with men. This was a radical idea, at least from the perspective of male society at the time.\n\nThe Bible states that God created Adam before Eve, leading early societies to view men as the leaders and women as subservient. In the eyes of men, women were perceived as docile, fragile, and emotional, deserving of gentle, protective treatment akin to that of pets. Women's roles were confined to domestic duties, child-rearing, and obedience to their husbands. This arrangement was seen as natural and unchangeable, with women's primary responsibilities being to maintain the home and family.\n\nWomen, however, were becoming restless and sought more than just domestic roles. They desired real, equal participation in society, the freedom to hold any job, wear what they pleased, and most importantly, the right to vote. Men, accustomed to their traditional roles, found it difficult to comprehend why women wanted to deviate from these norms. Feminism introduced the concept that women are human beings with the same rights and capabilities as men, and that sex discrimination is wrong.\n\nDue to the prevailing belief that women were the weaker sex, men established double standards in society. These standards made it challenging for women to achieve equal rights and recognition. Women had to fight against these ingrained beliefs and societal norms to gain the same opportunities and respect as men.", "speed": 0.6524564858067701, "eta": "00h04m55s"}

Jefferson made this statement back when the federalist and democratic parties were being established. Jefferson believed that in order for the government to operate at the best of its ability, the representatives must act as one. Many Americans are now seeing that this statement, made hundreds of years ago, is today coming true.\nTuesday, November 13, 1995, an event took place that left 800,000 workers out of a job with no pay. This event was so tragic not only because so many people were left without jobs, but also because it should have never occurred. This event is the shutdown of the United States government and it will not end until government officials. decide to work together and solve the problem that started this whole ordeal. I feel the American people elect representatives in the government to keep this from happening. When 800,000 workers, and counting, are out of a job for reasons out of their control, then the government officials are not doing their jobs.\nOctober the first, of each year, is the end of the govermnent's political year. The government year is called the fiscal year. By the end of each fiscal year the government must pass thirteen essential bills in order for the government to continue to operate. One of these bills is the United States budget for the next fiscal year. This may be the most important bill because without a budget (good or bad), government employees cannot be paid. Often government officials (congress, the president, and the presidents cabinet) wait until the end of the fiscal year to pass these bills. They do this because at the beginning of the next fiscal year elections take place. This causes a great deal of tension in the government. About august of every year a power struggle starts between the different political parties in office.\nIn many ways this division in power can be good. When a situation arises, there are more point or views to come up with a solution. No one person can control the government in a dictatorship. There are also disadvantages.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "\"There should be no partisanship in the government,\" claimed Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. This statement, made during the early stages of the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties, highlighted Jefferson's belief that unity among representatives was essential for effective governance. Many Americans today see this assertion, made centuries ago, becoming true in contemporary politics.\n\nTuesday, November 13, 1995, marked a tragic event when the U.S. government shut down, leaving 800,000 workers without pay. This shutdown was not only devastating for those affected but also a clear indication that political division within the government can have severe consequences. The shutdown occurred because government officials failed to work together and resolve the issues that led to the shutdown. It is the responsibility of the American people to elect representatives capable of preventing such occurrences. When workers are left without pay due to circumstances beyond their control, it is a sign that government officials are not fulfilling their duties.\n\nOctober 1st of each year marks the end of the government's fiscal year. During this period, thirteen essential bills must be passed for the government to continue operating. One of these bills is the United States budget for the following fiscal year, which is arguably the most critical. Without a budget, whether favorable or unfavorable, government employees cannot be properly compensated. Often, government officials\u2014congress, the president, and the cabinet\u2014delay passing these bills until the end of the fiscal year because elections typically take place at the start of the next fiscal year. This timing creates significant tension in the government.\n\nIn many ways, the division of power can be beneficial. When a situation arises, multiple perspectives can contribute to finding a solution. In a dictatorship, no single person can control the government. However, this division of power also has its drawbacks. When different political parties are in power, a struggle for control can hinder the government's ability to operate effectively and efficiently.", "speed": 0.6524564858067701, "eta": "00h04m55s"}

One the most potent solvents has been the practice of premarital sex. Premarital sex in itself, physically, does little or no harm in its action. The real problems come soon after and have long ranging affects. It is without any doubt that premarital sex is overall destructive because it leads to the lost of respect for women, the birth of illegitimate communities, and even the spread of sexually transmitted disease.

It didn't begin ten, twenty, or thirty-five years ago either, but premarital sex has truly changed during that time. The major change, of course, coming thirty-five years ago with the start of the \"Sexual Revolution\" in the sixties. This revolution brought about a sexual awareness. No longer was sex going to be a dark issue. Men and women became more educated about their bodies, how to prevent disease, how to better plan their families, and how to perform better in their sexual roles. Other reforms in gender and racial equality helped keep the revolution rolling. Unfortunately, as with many things, all the good things brought about by greater sexual education had there bad side affects. Side affects like the lowering of moral standards and the loss of person responsibility have made sexual revolution buzz words for when America headed down the toilet. People were given power over their sex and their sexuality, but they lost control of themselves. That power has corrupted people into thinking they can have it all for free. As far as premarital sex is involved, the idea is that \"the reward would be granted before the price was paid, and if this reward were the only thing desired why should one pay the price of marriage after enjoying intercourse\" (Reiss 175) has become prominent.

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In an age when government funding cuts loom on the horizon like an ominous storm cloud, it leaves many to wonder which area of government spending will be targeted next. While some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate given the reduced threat of attack from another superpower, others, such as government support for the arts, should be preserved and perhaps even increased. \n\nWhy should the arts, both visual and performing, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most fundamental reason lies in the anthropological perspective: since the dawn of human civilization, humanity has sought to interpret and depict its world. This depiction, often in enduring forms like cave and wall drawings, has allowed us to communicate the essence of early human thought to future generations. Through these artistic expressions, we leave a lasting impression that future generations can study and understand.\n\nArt also helps us communicate our values and ideals to one another. For instance, consider the use of decorative arts by French leaders like Louis XIV and Napoleon. These rulers employed art to showcase the opulence and prestige of their reigns, thereby communicating their values on a grand scale. Similarly, in our daily lives, children\u2019s drawings provide a clear example of how art can convey basic ideas without relying heavily on verbal communication. These drawings, though simple, are universally interpretable and convey the child\u2019s perspective in a precise, pictorial form.\n\nFurthermore, the performing and visual arts serve as powerful tools to unify communities. Much like team sports, members of a ballet troupe, for example, bond as they collaborate to produce quality performances, fostering camaraderie and friendship among fellow performers. Similarly, arts patrons who enjoy performances together can develop friendships and bonds over a shared interest. In this way, the arts play a crucial role in strengthening community ties and fostering a sense of shared identity.", "speed": 0.6455722732414017, "eta": "00h04m09s"}

I feel that, as a woman, there should be strict rules regarding abortions.\nWe all know the consequences of sex, especially unprotected sex and if a person decides to play the game they should be held accountable for the results of their horseplay. I feel that if a sensible, well-minded women consents to have sex, she is responsible for the results of her actions. Today, there are many protective devices that can help persons prevent pregnancies. The condom is not one hundred percent effective, but is about ninety-eight percent effective if used properly. The birth control pill is said to ninety-five percent effective in the prevention of pregnancy. If a condom and the birth control pill are used together, the risk of pregnancy is less than one percent. Other types of contraceptives include foams, the female condom, a five year injected tube placed in a woman's arm which injects a hormone that helps prevent pregnancies, a shot which acts like birth control pills but only has to be taken every three months, and spermicide. All of these methods are highly effective in pregnancy prevention. The prevention methods named above are all highly effective but there is a method that is one hundred percent, a method that should be practiced by all single persons should practice, which is abstinence. When using abstinence, a person does not have to worry about getting pregnant because they will not be in the game.\nWith all of these protective devices, a person has no excuse for wanting an abortion after consensual sex. Personally, I do not believe one person has the right to take away another person's life, even if that person is not fully developed into what he or she will be. Sure, it is supposed to be a woman's choice to say no I don't want this child, kill it, but that not very fair to the child.

These debates began over two decades ago, they have done nothing, but enlarge throughout the years. The two major different views of this subject are the main reasons for such controversy. The main question about this issue is: Should abortion be legal? This is a question that should be addressed because it deals with the lives of humans.\nSome people feel that this issue does not apply to them, but almost everyone picks a side or has an opinion about the topic. There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide. The true meaning of genocide is the systematic extermination or destruction of a political, racial or cultural group.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Abortion is a moral issue that has been constantly debated for over two decades, and these debates have only grown in intensity over the years.

Why? because it is a very soft color, and women are usually pictured as being soft and tender. Men do not usually wear pink because it is stereotypically considered a feminine color.\nCommercials always show this stereotype. The Skintimate shaving gel commercial shows a woman wearing pink holding a pink razor. The background has soft colors. on the Secret deodorant commercial, \"Strong enough for a man, but PH balanced for a woman,\" the woman is wearing again pink clothing, and the container for the deodorant is a soft blue with pink flowers on the container. Also commercials for feminine products, such as sanitary napkins, also have the stereotypical feminine color pink. Always maxi pads have white, pink, and light blue colors on the package. Again soft colors were used.\nPink is almost always worn by baby girls. When mothers bring their baby girls from the hospital, the baby girls are usually dressed in pink. Especially, when the babies are a few weeks old, baby girls are usually dressed in pink or other soft colors such as mint green or yellow. once a baby has developed its looks, there is no problem with the baby girl wearing blue. A mother would not want a person to come up to her child and have to ask if it is a girl or a boy. So if someone saw a baby wearing pink, they automatically assume that it is a girl.\nCommercials also show babies with this stereotypical point of view. The Huggies diapers commercial is a very good example of this stereotype because they have Huggies for girls and Huggies for boys. of course, the Huggies for girls are pink diapers, and the Huggies for boys diapers are blue.\nAlso baby products such as bottles, dishes, brushes, and combs are also stereotyped as pink for girls and blue for boys. A specific example is the Gerber bottles and dishes.\nAs for males, baby boys especially, blue is the\nstereotypical color. Baby boys are associated with blue.

Currently capital punishment is being left up to the individual state as to whether or not they decide to implement it as a form of punishment.  Advocates of this obscene form of punishment offer a handful of reasons justifying it's use.  At first glance these reasons seem to hold up, but one by one I will show you that these reasons are as ridiculous as the source they are trying to endorse.  Ounce society is enlightened of these statistics, they will see that capital punishment has no place in the justice of\nthis country.\nThe first claim of supporters is that they are under the opinion that it is much more expensive to keep a convicted criminal in prison for life than to simply pull their plug.  At first glance this statement seems to be more than rational.  The problem here is that people don't realize the big picture of the situation at hand.  Instead of capital punishment saving tax payers money, it actually does the complete opposite.  Let me throw a couple of statistics at you that I gathered doing a paper last year.  Currently to administer capital punishment upon a single individ ual it costs five times the amount than it would to inprison somebody from the age of eighteen to eighty years old.  How this statement can be valid is due to the reasons that when someone recieves the death penalty they are not killed the next day.  Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years.  During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals.  These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs.  When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system.  This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system.

That questions is should women be allowed to attend the Citadel. There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel.

That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos.

People might like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a woman, I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women; some are strong, intelligent, and capable, while others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as poorly. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say that all women could, because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people argue that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges. Everyone deserves the chance to try.\n\nIn our country, if a school is publicly funded, it cannot discriminate against race, religion, gender, or handicapped people. The Citadel is publicly funded, so what makes it any different? Why should it not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools began to say you could only come here if you were Hispanic or Polish, our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would require a significant increase in the number of teachers, drivers, cleaners, and cooks.", "speed": 0.6455722732414017, "eta": "00h04m09s"}

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The debate over whether or not marijuana should be legalized has been ongoing since the 1960s, and it is clear that this issue will not fade away.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical/literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music. All these examples (and more) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know. \nThe stories told in this genre of literature, however, are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature. It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States. When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity. The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference. Without learning about the past (and present) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Our country is often referred to as a \"melting-pot,\" suggesting that people from diverse backgrounds have joined together to form a homogeneous American identity.

However, the white people often do not accept them; at best, they tolerate other ethnicities. Maxine Hong Kingston points out in \"Reparation Candy\" that the drug store clerk gave us candy simply because he thought we were beggars. The clerk does not realize that the candy is supposed to stop the curse of delivering medicine to the wrong house. This display of tolerance highlights the underlying prejudice. Barbara Rice Cleary explains that all Americans need to be accepting of other cultures. It seems true, as Barbara Rice also points out, that the drug store clerk\u2019s actions demonstrate a lack of understanding and acceptance. \n\nReading ethnic American literature helps us to see the harm of nonacceptance. The negro spirituals clearly point out the African Americans' desire to move to a better place.

Every single ethnic group has suffered a great amount in their attempt to gain equality. That suffering they have gone through has left many wounds that have not totally healed. Knowing why those wounds are there help to clearify why people do the thing that they do today. Ethnic American literature explains why those wounds are there and usually the literature presents to the people a way to overcome the wounds. For example, in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club the Chinese American daughters have a tough time understanding themselves because they are caught between two cultures that clash in values. The girls are the victims of the clash because they do not know which culture to follow. The Chinese culture gives them no choices, and the American culture gives them too many choices.

To say writing about this topic is selfish is to show a great lack of understaning of human nature. The writers of ethnicity that have written on the subject of \"Who am I?\" have been anything but selfish. They have given a great gift to the people of their own background, as well as and maybe even a greater gift to the rest of humanity.\nThe Ethnic American Authors' addressing of the issue of self understanding is hugely important because of the adverse circumstances that all American of ethnic backgrounds are subjected to.

She is born into society that is trying to crush her and any self-respect she might have because she is black, and female. She is thought of as and treated as nothing. Therefore she naturally thinks of herself as nothing. Walker shows African Americans that they must find a self-understanding that is void of the standards that were and are imposed upon them by the white race.

Violence, then, is a part of their everyday lives. For whatever reasons, these American cultures face a difficult reality which some feel the need to express through writing. Most ethnic American writers are from the situations they write about; they've experienced the violence firsthand and want to pass it on to their readers. Sometimes, they need to write just to express their pain or uncertain feelings, though more often, their purpose is to teach a lesson. They use violence from realistic situations to make others aware of the problems in ethnic American cultures.

The factors implicated in these tragedies are frustration and aggression. Often times, a person will get mad at another person. They tend to get frustrated and then wish to relay this frustration through aggression. Aggression can lead to death if a gun is lying around.

In his aggressive rage, he may kill his brother even though this was not his intention. Another factor in this high number of tragedies is the availability of guns in homes and on the streets. This can lead to the death of children by other children who did not realize what a gun could do. The availability of the gun can also turn a rather trivial fight into a murder.\nRacial prejudice is still around today as it was 30 years ago, but it has taken on different forms. One type is aversive racism. This is where a person who does not like a certain minority avoids being around that minority so he does not have to allow his prejudices to come forth. Another fairly new type of prejudice is symbolic racism. In this, a person equates a certain group to a certain social problem. For example, many people feel that all of the welfare recipients are black. Therefore, they view blacks as lazy and unwilling to work. However, it is a fact that most of the recipients of welfare are white. \nAnother prejudice has taken on new forms, it has also declined in the past thirty years.

The statistics discussed in class from the SC report do in fact support Lunde's theory. Of all the homicides in SC, the majority of the victims did know the murderer, they were either a family member, friend, or acauaintice. The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with. Due to this, aggression is more apt to occur and be expressed towards these people we know. The statement that often the trigger pulls the finger points to the idea that once individuals are in these frustrating situations, their aggression tends to escalate uncontrolabley and without preconceived intention, they end up murdering someone.\nRacial prejudice today is somewhat less tolerated in our society compared to 30 years ago. Due to the strong effects of conformity, prejudice has therefore become more \"under the table\". People who are prejudice may not want to explicitly express their views in front of groups who may disagree, therefore their prejudice may not actually end up in discrimination against minorities. In other cases, these individucals will use symbolic prejudice to express their racism more acceptedly. In symbolic prejudice someone will feel negative against something for reasons they don't express as the reasons. For example a racist white male may be against welfare supposedly because the recipients are lazy etc., his true feeling is that most welfare recepients are black and lazy, not just lazy. I think that there is much more of this type of racism prelavent today, as well as the attitude of \"they\" are o.k. as long as they aren't around me because I'm not comfortable around them. <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, approximately 90% of homicide victims knew or were acquainted with their killer.

The reason for this is that people who are friends end up fighting and often times end up wanting to hurt one another. They do not have the intent to kill at all they only want to cause pain, not death. This is hard though when guns are involved. It is much too easy to get carried away in aggresive feelings and end up killing someone. \nPeome become frustrated with people they love more often than they become frustrated with others. These feelings often lead to aggression, which too often leads to killings over something that started out as a simple frustration. \nIn South Carolina, these statistics are supported. There are more homicides around holidays (ie. Christmas, the 4th of July, etc.) This is b/c these are the times when families are together. There is the most opportunity for frustration and therefore aggression.\nRacial Prejudice was accepted 30 years ago. At least it was more accepted then it is today. In a time when it was more accepted there was no reason to hide it, make excuses for it, or try to justify it. Today, people have a hardert time just being openly prejudice. People must now justify their actions not only to themselves but to others as well. For example, in one study while students were just as likely to help black & white students who had demonstrated effort. However, if the black student had not then it was easy to justify not helping him by saying that he was lazy and didnt care anyway. If the white student had not demonstrated effort the student would still help him and assume that something else of equal importance got in the way of preparing.\nPeople need to find ways to justify their prejudice attitudes. For example, soon after the students at Kent state were shot there were many rumors about them being dirty, oversexed & lazy & the deserved to be killed. This was done to make the people become desentivezed to what they were doing. Justify it by saying they deserved it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "According to Lunde, a staggering 90% of homicides involve individuals who knew each other previously.

But to often revenge or payback outweighs the original action ten-fold. A good example would be two brothers in an argument, one insults the other and in turn a gun is introduced.

When we encounter a stranger, we generally do not care enough about him to allow frustration to develop. However, since frustration leads to aggression, and we normally become frustrated with those whom we like and love, human beings have a higher tendency for inflicting aggressive behavior on our loved ones.\nFifty years ago, when segregation was enacted, this led to stereotyping and prejudice.

Desegregation, shortly thereafter, raised prejudiced attitudes because of competition, and the fundamental attribution theory. <*> in classroom situations, for example, the white and black students lived in different social status, causing black students to feel intimidated about answering questions and speaking in class.

Everybody always has a complaint about some part of the transport system in the United Kingdom. What is wrong, and what can we do about it?\nThe amount of criticism aimed at the British rail network increases daily, and not without reason. Much of the rolling stock is old, slow, noisy and uncomfortable. Passengers whose life seems to revolve around annoying others - listening to not-quite-personal stereos, smoking in no smoking sections, putting bags on seat - are a common sight on trains. All this makes the train less appealling to the general public, and, in particular, the commuter.\nAnother problem is that of understaffing, both on trains and at stations. This leads to an increase in fare dodging, which is now quite possible unintentionally - with ticket offices closed at both ends of the journey, and no guard, who are you supposed to pay?\nAll this leads to trains being unprofitable, except on a few major commuter routes. Many things have been tried to reverse this, but to no avail. Closing small lines which regularly lose money may seem sensible but leads to less people getting trains in general - after all if you have to drive twenty miles to the nearest station, you might as well just drive to wherever you are going. Increasing or decreasing prices could be tried, but as trains are more expensive than cars for most journeys anyway, this would have little effect. \nThe only way to make profits is to get more people on trains, and this requires an improvement in services. This would initially cost a lot, and unfortunately sufficient funding is never available. \nAs more and more people use cars, traffic in city centres during rush ours comes to a near standstill. More cars arrive, get stuck in jams, and spread the congestion further and further out of the city, until motorways and bypasses become blocked.\nThe problem is obvious - there are too many cars on Britain's roads. There are two ways around the problem - reduce the number of cars, or build more roads.\nIn cities, where all traffic jams start, there is no room for more roads - every square yard is already in use. The only place more roads can be built is outside cities, building more and wider motorways.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Traffic jams are becoming larger and more frequent, while trains are never on time. It is little wonder that everyone has a complaint about some part of the transport system in the United Kingdom. What is the root of the problem, and what can we do about it?\n\nThe British rail network faces increasing criticism daily, and for good reason. Much of the rolling stock is old, slow, noisy, and uncomfortable. Passengers who seem to revolve their lives around annoying others\u2014like listening to non-personal stereos, smoking in no-smoking sections, or putting bags on seats\u2014are a common sight on trains. All this makes the train less appealing to the general public, and especially to commuters.\n\nAnother significant issue is understaffing, both on trains and at stations. This leads to an increase in fare dodging, which is now quite possible unintentionally. With ticket offices closed at both ends of the journey, and no guard, it\u2019s unclear whom to pay. These problems make the rail network unprofitable, except on a few major commuter routes. Despite various attempts to reverse this trend, such as closing small lines and adjusting prices, none have been successful.\n\nThe only feasible way to make profits is to get more people on trains, and this requires an improvement in services. However, the necessary funding is rarely available, and initial costs are high. As more and more people rely on cars, city center traffic during rush hours comes to a near standstill. More cars arrive, get stuck in jams, and spread the congestion further out of the city, until motorways and bypasses become blocked.\n\nThe problem is clear: there are too many cars on Britain's roads. Two potential solutions exist: reduce the number of cars, or build more roads. In cities, where all traffic jams start, there is no room for more roads; every square yard is already in use. The only place where more roads can be built is outside cities, where wider and more extensive motorways can be constructed.", "speed": 0.6589783574921579, "eta": "00h03m15s"}

Today, the vast amount of UK families own a car. It is, no doubt, a fast way of commuting to and from destinations with little stress on the body, however traffic congestion is becoming a major concern in any city or town. It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it was before. Lancaster is a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.\nAlong with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared to give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common in the major American cities and even, at times, London.\nWith such are large no. of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. \u00a3 billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in as best a condition as possible.\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with he number of cars. One major factor of these accidents is road stress which can again be due to traffic congestion.\nAll of these problems, one way or another, can all be linked with congestion and hence the number of cars on the road. To attempt to lessen this number, I have a number of solutions.\n1. Park and Ride - have cars outside of town and catch a free/cheap bus into town.\n2. Improvent of public transport - Cheaper fares, cleaner, more pleasant environment to encourage them to leave their cars at home.\n3.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The problems facing road transport are numerous and can have potentially severe penalties.

This is putting increasing stress on our road network, especially along major commercial routes, such as Birmingham to London, and in town centres where the streets and roads were not designed for such a large number of cars. This large no. of cars is causing congestion and general \"wear and tear\" of our roads.\nThe easy access to cars has enabled people to move out of the polluted, \"grey\" cities and into out-of-town villages where they can commute. This has meant that whereas people used to walk or catch a bus to work they now drive into work. This is especially true in the major cities such as London and Birmingham and this can be seen in the horrific traffic problems which plague these cities. When faced with large traffic jams there is the tendancy to find shortcuts and this can lead to heavy traffic through rural villages or residential areas. The number of heavy goods vehicles on the road networks has also increased and frequent lorry traffic can damage roads not built for this purpose quickly. They also restrict the flow of traffic on motorways especially when in large numbers.\nThe rail transport in the United Kingdom also has many problems. One of these is the increasing number of people who prefer to drive rather than catch a train. This unpopularity has come about especially over shorter distances due to the delays and strike problems etc.\nThe privatisation and sell off of many of the more profitable networks such as the South East has lead to a profit-base operation meaning fewer trains, higher fares and the closure of many of the smaller stations.\nAnother problem is the unwillingness of industry to transport goods by train often due to the limited rail network and the cost compared to transport by HGV's.\nThe opening of the Eurotunnel, connecting the UK network to the rest of Europe, it is hoped, will stimulate the rail industry but a number of problems and Eurotunnel's increasing debt has done little to convince the general public.\nThere are many possible solutions to the problems I have identified many of which would compliment each other.

Obviously more roads are needed. However there is a limit. Nobody wants a concrete jungle for a country. There is though an optimum balance which I believe has not yet been reached. It is when bypasses of bypasses are being built that the country will reach saturation levels. To be fair the authority's are in a no win situation here.

The same format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate. \nRoad transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room.

Consequently, congestion is an ongoing challenge on most British roads, whether motorways or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads are excluded from this discussion. Traffic jams are on the rise due to two main reasons: an increasing number of cars on the road and poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion was evident. For instance, one-way systems in many cities could have been designed to alleviate current congestion. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles seek to use the same roads at the same time.

The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety. Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There are numerous challenges facing both road and rail transport in the UK.

While the legal limit for drinking and driving has recently been increased, lowering the limit by several units would deter many people from using their own vehicles and encourage them to use public transport. Increasing law enforcement could also be effective, such as giving the police more rights to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras. Additionally, possibly imposing larger fines and reducing the national speed limit could encourage drivers to exercise more caution.\n\nThe condition of roads is often a local issue rather than a national concern. It is therefore the responsibility of local councils to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require local councils to obtain more funding from the government.\n\nIn contrast, safety is much less of a concern for rail transport. The major issue here is efficiency. It is often noted that trains frequently run late, and there is a high incidence of delays. As a result, many rail passengers are switching to alternative forms of transport, such as cars for shorter journeys and airplanes for long-distance trips.\n\nA significant portion of the blame for this inefficiency lies with the outdated trains, which are generally slower than modern models such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.", "speed": 0.6589783574921579, "eta": "00h03m15s"}

All the problems facing railways at the moment are financial and not geographic. There is not the widespread interest in rail travel which there once was.

The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six. The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "On Britain's roads, there is an ever-increasing volume of traffic, which the road network is no longer able to carry without causing hold-ups and traffic jams.

This is the main problem facing the UK's transport system. The reasons for this are many and varied. People of today want more freedom and have more disposable income, both factors which will lead to an increase in car ownership. Many people also feel unsafe to walk or to use public transport to get to places, and mothers who would have walked to school when they were young insist on ferrying their children to school by car, as they believe, correctly or not, that there are too many child abducters around for it to be safe for children on the streets. These views are supported by cases like the James Bulger case, and the Fred and Mary West case which have very high publicity and give increasing public awareness to the people on the streets today. People also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish, and can travel \"door-to-door\" instead of having to walk to bus stops and stations. The enourmos levels of vehicles on the roads have meant that using a bicycle to travel has become unacceptable to many people, due to the danger and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets.\nRail travel has seen decreased popularity in recent years, due to the immense popularity of the car now. Some people may not use trains due to their seemingly unreliable services. Trains also fail to offer the freedom of choice available with cars, as the passengers are tyed to the timetables and locations of railway stations.\nI think that the government should help Britains transport by aiming to decrease the amount of car useage and increase the usage of buses, trains and other forms of public transport.

This highlights a significant flaw in the system, as it may not always reflect the true will of the majority.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of each constituency having an MP who represents the local beliefs in Parliament has its own set of issues. For example, an MP recently decided to switch parties. While it is often claimed that voters choose based on the MP's individual beliefs, in practice, many voters base their decisions on the party's performance and current policies. Once a party is in power, it can freely change its policies until the next general election, where it may make empty promises to regain support.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, the parliamentary system can still be considered the best framework for governance. For instance, in comparison to dictatorships, the parliamentary system provides a check on power and offers a more democratic process. A single madman with an ill-conceived plan would struggle to control a country through such a system, potentially causing economic damage to both the country and its allies.\n\nNo system can be entirely fair and perfect, as it will always cater to some people at the expense of others. Achieving a truly fair system of government would require a small, tightly knit group of about ten people, but even then, discontent would likely persist.", "speed": 0.6817131462006689, "eta": "00h02m22s"}

The 'thrill of the chase' has no substitutes.\nNow that we have seen both sides to this argument solutions should be discussed.

In many ways it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have be necessary to cull the numbers of foxes but now foxes have become so rare that they are rarely seen in the wild.\nFoxes are simply hunted for fun and for trohpy's. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests and occasionaly foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats but now public opinion has put this to an end. \nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population. The foxes are not really given a chance. Once one is spotted by the hunting party a pack of hounds is sent after it. All the fox can do is flee in desparation. It does not really stand a chance against the overwhelming odds of about twenty blood thirsty hounds.

In today's society it is an outdated and barbaric \"sport\" which, in my opinion, should be banned. \nIn this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare. Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals, which are going to be slaughtered, should be transported. These measures include the time the animals spend on the road, how much room they have etc. etc. However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs. This, apparantly, is a sport.\nThe Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes. Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government. It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators. At least if one dog fights another the fight is, in some, fair. But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others. The fox stands no chance, why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned.\nFox hunting is, for the most part, enjoyed by the upper-class. It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse, dogs and riding equipment (eg. helmet, boots etc.) you also need land to do it in. It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox-hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class, wealthy supporters who fox hunt.\nIn a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox. The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries (eg. when banning whaling) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals (eg. the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The issue of whether fox hunting should be banned is becoming increasingly debated in today's society.

There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits. If you ban fox hunting it means that the protesters will have won and this gives them the incentive to protest about something else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The reason why fox hunting should be banned is because it is a cruel sport.

The reasons for killing foxes include their predation on chickens and the enjoyment of the social side of the sport.

I have never done any boxing in my entire life but I would still be prepared to defend the sport of boxing against anyone wishing to ban it.\nFirst of all, there are already few enough liberties in this country when compared with other nations of similar political and economic conditions such as France and the United States. The day that the Government starts to ban popular sports like boxing is the day I apply for American citizenship. The only argument of those who are for the banning of the sport is the fact that in the past few years there have been three incidents in Britain which have left one boxer dead and two others with brain damage. These men were professionals, they were not stupid. All boxers know the risks and are surrounded by people who are trained to look after them. Boxing is a high risk, short term career the men who do it are aware of this, that is why they are paid so highly. I recently read a report that stated that football players who play full back or centre forward in non-league football are more prone to long term head injuries than boxers because they often go without treatment and without taking precautions when they get concussed. This is cleer evidence that without the large sums of money envolved boxing would be far more dangerous because the medical care would be poorer. So, those that say the money pushes these boxers to their fates may be wrong in thinking so because it is the money which protects them in a way.\nHow could we ever ban a sport as full of skill and traditional values (such as good sportsmanship) as boxing is beyond me. Perhaps the fact that it is a sport which almost entirely excludes women counts against it. I can imagine how much feminists would dislike its machoism. But this is no reason to stop this ancient sport. I watched the Benn-McLellan fight in 1994 and despite the shocking consequences for McLellan it was one of the most memorable sporting occasions I have ever seen; The same can be said for Ali and Foreman's \"Rumble in the Jungle\" and I wonder if anyone who watched Frank Bruno win his world title fight this year will ever forget it.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I am not a boxing fanatic, nor would I describe myself as an enthusiast.

The day the government starts to ban such sports is the day I would consider applying for American citizenship.\n\nThe main argument from those who advocate for the ban of boxing is the tragic incidents in Britain over the past few years, where three boxers have either died or suffered severe brain damage. However, these men were professionals, and they understood the risks involved. All boxers are aware of the dangers and are supported by individuals trained to ensure their safety. Boxing is a high-risk, short-term career, and the men who choose this path are compensated accordingly for the inherent risks.\n\nInterestingly, a recent report indicated that football players who play full back or centre forward in non-league football are more prone to long-term head injuries than boxers. This is due to the lack of treatment and precautions when players experience concussions. Thus, without the substantial financial incentives, boxing would likely be more dangerous due to poorer medical care. This suggests that the money involved in boxing actually serves to protect the boxers, rather than pushing them to dangerous outcomes.\n\nHow could we ever ban a sport as full of skill and traditional values\u2014such as good sportsmanship\u2014as boxing? Perhaps the exclusion of women from boxing could be seen as a drawback, but this is no reason to eradicate this ancient sport. I vividly remember the Benn-McLellan fight in 1994, despite its shocking aftermath for McLellan, it remains one of the most memorable sporting occasions I have ever witnessed. Similarly, the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" between Ali and Foreman is etched in my memory, and I suspect few would forget Frank Bruno's world title victory this year.\n\nIn conclusion, boxing is a sport rich in tradition and skill, and it would be a great loss to ban it.", "speed": 0.6817131462006689, "eta": "00h02m22s"}

This discussion arose after lots of boxers started to get serious injuries and brain damages as a result of boxing.\nBoxing today, and has always, been a popular spectator sport and nowadays it is a big money business. Fighters, at the top, get paid millions of pounds to fight. The fighters themselves, the managers, the sponsors, the organisers, the betting shops and most spectators do not want the sport to be banned. In opposition are the people who do not like any blood sports, doctor etc, recipients of serious injuries ie, boxers themselves and their relations, etc.\nThe people who want the sport to be banned, say this because it is not right for people to fight, and there is a too high risk of serious injury and brain damage caused by the severe pounding that the head takes during a boxing match. They say that boxing should be banned because the only way to stop these accidents happening is to stop boxing, and the only way to stop people boxing is to ban boxing and make it illegal. \nThe illegalisation of boxing I believe however could only lead to the introduction of underground boxing matches if out of sight of the law. And this could be a bad thing because although there would many people there working, laying bets etc. there would be no supervision and professional referring so boxing accidents may occur and they may result worst than they do now, because there would be no immediate medical attention due to the illegal nature of the matches.\nThis may of course not happen and the banning of boxing will go down badly, but with that will be the end of it.\nThere semm to be many more reasons why boxing should be kept going rather than banned.\nOne of the major arguments is that boxing is the most natural sport in the world, and so why should it be banned just because of the risk of injury. There is just as much chance of getting brain damage by being in a car crash etc. as there is in a boxing match, and car crashes occur much more often than boxing matches.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Over the past two or three years, there has been a continual debate over whether or not boxing should be banned. This discussion arose after many boxers started to suffer from serious injuries and brain damage due to the sport. Boxing, both now and historically, is a popular spectator sport and a significant moneymaker. Top fighters earn millions of pounds for their matches, and the sport benefits not just the fighters but also their managers, sponsors, organizers, betting shops, and spectators. However, those opposing the sport argue that boxing should be banned because it involves fighting and carries an unacceptable risk of serious injury and brain damage, which can occur from the severe pounding the head sustains during a boxing match.\n\nThe people who want boxing banned argue that the only way to prevent these accidents is to stop the sport entirely, and the only way to stop people from boxing is to ban it and make it illegal. However, I believe that illegalizing boxing could lead to the emergence of underground matches, which would lack proper supervision and medical attention. This could result in more severe injuries than those seen in regulated boxing matches. Although there would be many people involved in these illegal matches, betting, and other activities, the lack of professional refereeing and medical oversight could increase the risk of serious accidents.\n\nThere are, however, several strong arguments in favor of keeping boxing legal. One of the most compelling is that boxing is a natural sport and should not be banned just because of the risk of injury. It is important to note that the risk of brain damage is comparable to that of car accidents, which occur much more frequently than boxing matches. Additionally, boxing provides a platform for athletes to showcase their skills, earn a living, and inspire others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the risk of injury in boxing is concerning, the sport's cultural significance, economic benefits, and the natural nature of the sport itself provide strong reasons to keep boxing legal. The key to minimizing the risks lies in improving safety regulations and ensuring that proper medical care is available, rather than outright banning the sport.", "speed": 0.6817131462006689, "eta": "00h02m22s"}

During a fight a boxer may receive several hundred punches to the head, and each time that he gets punched he looses more and more brain cells.\nThe brain is encased in the skull, but not only in the skull is the brain but also a liquid 'shock-absorber' to protect the rain. Even though there is the protective liquid the brain still gets bounced about against the skull, damaging it more and more every time. So, a boxer who has been boxing for a number of years, ten for example, and retires is very likely to have brain damage and it could be very severe or hardly noticable but the damage is still there. Getting away from the long term effects to the short term effects, yes brain cells are still being killed but when a boxer receives a very strong punch direct to the face not only would it damage his nose, eyes, teeth and general facial features but it could also cause him to enter a coma, haemorage or die.\nAnother aspect that many people are quite opposed to is the absolutely huge salaries that top rank boxers receive. The question that people have is: is that person really worth several million pounds? Just for a fight against another top ranking boxer that may only last a couple of rounds. Another adaptation of cost is the cost of having so many medical units and doctors at the fight when they could be somewhere else, more important, where people aren't getting paid to fight.\nThe major influence keeping boxing going is all the people around the world who enjoy watching the sport, there is an incredibly big demand for it. Boxing is one of the most popular sports, and it will be difficult to ban it. Not only does it satisfy the viewers but a lot of companies also sponsor boxing which brings a lot of advertisement and capital for them.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing is one of the most popular sports of our time, yet it is also one of the most dangerous.

The question that arises is whether these individuals are truly worth several million pounds for a fight that might only last a few rounds. Additionally, there is the cost of having multiple medical units and medical personnel at each fight, which could be redirected to more critical needs where people are not being paid to fight.\n\nThe primary reason boxing continues to thrive is the global demand for the sport. It is one of the most popular, and it would be challenging to ban it. Boxing not only satisfies the audience's entertainment needs but also attracts significant sponsorship from various companies.

The constant pounding of the head during a match doesn't necessarily do take it's toll immediately, but as a boxer's career continues, the chances of him having some kind of serious brain damage are fairly high.

Should boxing be banned. My answer to all of these questions is no. Maybe boxing is brutal, but to fight is part of human nature and I feel there is no point in trying to stop people fighting in controlled circumstances. Who has the right to tell someone whether they are able to take a chance and face the risk of death. If boxing were banned where would we draw the line, skiing? mountaineering? diving? darts?

This century it's popularity has increased greatly, due on part to the personalities of such greats as Mohumed Ali, George Foreman and Henry Cooper.\nHowever there is a tragic side to the sport, upon which the anti-boxing lobbyers base their opinions. The death of Scottish welterarght Jim Murray in the ring as recent as this October have renewed calls for the immediate banning of boxing. These tragic events, following on closely from the regretable like states that Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson have been left in, does little to help boxing's image and gives the viewer a sobering touch when contrasted with the antics of the likes of \"Prince\" Naseem Husein and Chris Eubank.\nThis apparent barbarianism is not helped by the behaviour of certain boxers. The claims of Oliver McCall, prior to his World Championship clash with Frank Bruno, that he would extract revenge for Gerald McClellan upon Bruno, have given the anti-boxing league fresh impetus in their drive for the banning of the sport. When this behaviour is added to that of Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn before their clashes, and one begins to agree.\nWhilst such behaviour cannot be condoned, it must be remembered that boxers do realise the risk of their chosen profession, just as other sportsmen do. When Jim Murray died, fresh calls were made for the abolition of boxing. However, when Ayrton Senna crashed and died at Imola in 1994, an equally tragic event, few calls were made to ban motorracing. On the contrary people were discussing new rules for the bodywork of the car, rather than why there was only one set of tyres on one of the most notorious corners in motor racing. Both sportsmen realised the risks that the were taking when setting out in their chosen profession, and sadly, both paid the ultimate price.\nAnother question that must be raised when discussing the parts of banning boxing is, what would happen to it. Almost certainly it would go underground. This would do little to eliminate the problem due to the fact that there would be less provision for safety than if it were legal.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Boxing has existed in its popular form since the last century and has undergone significant development since its early days of backstreet bare-knuckle fights.

The tragic deaths of boxers such as Jim Murray in October, and the severe injuries sustained by Gerald McClellan and Michael Watson, have reignited calls for the immediate ban of the sport. These events, when juxtaposed with the more controversial behavior of some boxers like \"Prince\" Naseem Hussein and Chris Eubank, further damage boxing\u2019s image.\n\nThe behavior of certain boxers, such as Oliver McCall's claims of extracting revenge for Gerald McClellan, has provided the anti-boxing lobby with fresh impetus.

Yet, when Ayrton Senna died in a motor racing accident in 1994, similar tragic events did not lead to calls for the ban of motor racing. Instead, discussions focused on improving safety measures.\n\nThe question of what would happen if boxing were banned also warrants consideration. If the sport went underground, there would likely be fewer safety provisions, which could exacerbate the problems rather than solve them.

When boxing is seen through these fighers agility and skill are thrown to the fore and the ugly side of boxing is forgotten.\nIt cannot be denied by any boxer that boxing is dangerous and that each time he walks into the ring he is risking his life? Many opponents to boxing argue that this risk in itself means that boxing is not a sport but is malicious and these boxers ought not be allowed to make that decision especially when they have families.\nduring the last year/two years there have been incidents which the sport of boxing wants to forget and try and get boxing it's name of 'entertainment' back. The arguament came to the fore again that boxing ought to be banned when Chris Eubank fought Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed and with brain damage. These two men were both professional fighters, the fact that Michael Watson has ended up how he is, is as much Michael Watson's fault for putting himself there as it is Chris Eubank's for doing it to him. However Michael Watson has never been able to forgive Chris Eubank, and many critics believe, that as sport is for enjoyment, no sporting event should end up with opponents not speaking to each other because it turns it into a war, which means a higher likelihood of someone being seriously hurt.\nAnother incident very similar to this was between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, and Gerald McClelland end up in a wheelchair.

However, it cannot be denied that boxing is dangerous, and each time a boxer steps into the ring, they take a risk with their life. Many opponents to boxing argue that this risk makes it not a sport but a malicious activity, and boxers should not be allowed to make such a decision, especially when they have families involved.\n\nIn the past few years, incidents have occurred that the sport of boxing wants to forget and aims to distance itself from, in an effort to restore its image as 'entertainment.' The argument that boxing should be banned resurfaced following Chris Eubank's fight with Michael Watson. Michael Watson ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed, and with brain damage. Both fighters share responsibility for the outcome of this fight; however, Michael Watson has never forgiven Chris Eubank. Critics argue that since sport is meant for enjoyment, no sporting event should result in opponents not speaking to each other, as it turns the event into a war and increases the likelihood of serious injury.\n\nA similar incident occurred between Gerald McClelland and Nigel Benn, in which Gerald McClelland ended up in a wheelchair. Months later, McClelland's friend, Oliver McCall, threatened to take revenge on Frank Bruno. These events highlight the potential for the 'idol' talk in boxing to set a bad example for children, as they witness not only a 'superstar' threatening to paralyse an opponent but also the threat of revenge.\n\nThese tragic events are ones no one wants to see repeated, and many opponents to boxing believe that such incidents should not be allowed to happen again by calling for the banning of the sport.

Only recently though has it been debated so strongly. Over the past two years there has been many events which has marred boxing as a 'brutal sport'. In the Eubank-Watson fight, just over two years ago, Watson was left at the end of a great fight unconscious and fighting for his life. He had suffered a major blot clot in his brain and after serious surgery and over eight months I hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a serious speaking disorder. One young man's life smashed by just a twelve round fight. Nearly one year ago another man, McClellan, was also left in a critical condition after his fight with Eubank. He is still in hospital  to this day, recovering. The most recent incident which has fuelled the debate has been the death of the young Scotsman - James Murray. After suffering a brain haemorage during his World Championship defence, he was left in a coma with serious brain damage. He died later the next day. These three events are only a fraction of the incidents occuring in a boxing ring which have caused controversy over the sport.\nA boxer's risks do not stop when he retires. Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in the sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain. This damage has built up every fight and the boxer is ore likely, even though he doesn't perticipitate in the sport any more, to have a brain haemorrage or a stroke. They are also very likely to suffer, in their old age, from a serious and sometimes fatal disease called Parkinson's disease. It affects the nervous system very badly and can lead, in some cases, to paralysation. Is this kind of a risk really worth a life in the sport of boxing?\nThere are, however, many reasons why the sport of boxing should not be banned. A large percentage of teenage children or young adults will have heard of the events involving Watson, McClellan and Murray. If they didn't read it then they'll, no doubt, have heard it on the news or from friends.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The case for banning boxing as a sport has been debated for several years, with increasing intensity only in the past two years.

Following serious surgery and over eight months in the hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a significant speech disorder.

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated.

Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA) the lottery was most popular with people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty. Stuck in the poverty trap, where any wages are offset by the twas in benifits,  it was predicted that people would spend money they couldn't afford on a gamble they had no chance in winning.

It is now known that only eight pence in the pound has been given to good causes, and this has also resulted in another of the warnings being proved correct; that donations to legitimate charities has significanlly fallen since the introcution of the Lottery.\nOpposition to the lottery by betting shops was disregarded by many but the popularity of other forms of gambling have also fallen since the Lottery's introduction.

The vast majority saw the idea as an exciting one and were interested in taking part in such a large-scale competition where such huge amounts of money were at stake. However, some people saw the lottery as a bad thing which would tend to become a hopeless addiction. These people tended to be those whose ideas and actions the general public are expected to follow; such as church leaders, or members of Parliament.\nThe arguments which these people suggested were numerous. Firstly, the amount of money which the jackpot winners were likely to receive was deemed as 'too much' or even 'unseemly'. The objectors felt that such a large amount of money (up to \u00a39 million on any normal lottery draw) was too much to be given to just one party. The recent 'double rollover' jackpot fund gave a figure of \u00a342 million which, theoretically, could have gone to just one lucky winner. This was deemed by the Bishop of Durham as 'an obscene amount of money', and many other members of the religious fraternity agreed and made their thoughts on the matter public.\nSecondly, many people believe that the amount of the cost of each ticket which goes to various charities is far too little. At present this stands at 5%. People feel that this amount is not enough, especially as one of the main reasons for the introduction of a British national lottery was the issue of raising funds for home charities and needy causes.\nThis issue is coupled with the profit margin which the lottery organisers, Camelot, obtain. People deemed this to be far too high and believed that if some of the profits which Camelot gained were transferred to the charity fund, things would be a lot fairer for everyone.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "When the UK's National Lottery was first discussed, people were instantly divided in opinion.

In the past few years, a number of Private Member's Bi lls were put before Parliament in favour of a National Lottery, but were defeated in each case. However, with the weight of the government behind it, the National Lottery was eventually approved. \nMuch of the objection to the National Lottery came from church leaders. Bishops from the Church of England have condemned the widespread encouragement of gambling, leaders of the Methodist church have expressed great concern at the effect on low income families who spend more than they can afford on tickets, and cardinals in the Catholic church have criticised the system for sharing out the 'good causes' money.\nDisasters, from a public relations point of view, has followed Camelot, the managers of the National Lottery, from the start.

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend \u00a310-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points. Deciding whether it should have been introduced or not is very much a personal thing and depends on how importantly you rate the points I have ephasised in this essay. I believeit is a benefit to the country.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The National Lottery was introduced to Britain in November 1994 and has since become increasingly popular, involving millions of people across the country each week. Since its inception, the lottery has sparked many objections and complaints, primarily around two main concerns.\n\nThe first of these concerns is the financial impact on different socio-economic groups. For people in higher society, a weekly 'flutter' on the National Lottery has no significant effect on their financial position. These individuals can afford to spend between \u00a310-20 on the lottery. However, the real concern lies with what I term 'working class citizens.' These individuals work hard throughout the year and struggle to afford spending money they cannot afford on the lottery. The problem is that many of them do indeed spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second major concern is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery, after all, is essentially another form of gambling. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million, while the likelihood of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. Although it is a form of gambling, it is particularly concerning that the lottery is accessible to 16-year-olds. This accessibility, combined with the ease of purchasing scratch cards, is a significant issue. The instant gratification of these cards, coupled with the attraction of winning money quickly, can encourage gambling among people of all ages, including those under the legal gambling age.\n\nDespite these concerns, the National Lottery has its merits. One of the primary advantages is its role in helping charities and societies. The lottery has funded numerous projects, from providing expensive equipment for a young child with brain problems to building a new village hall in a small community in the Shetland Islands. These funds have helped young and old, in various parts of the country.\n\nMoreover, the National Lottery has created jobs, encouraged spending, and given many people the opportunity to dream of a richer life. The lottery has provided a form of hope and aspiration that can improve the quality of life for many.\n\nIn conclusion, the National Lottery has both positive and negative aspects. Whether it should have been introduced ultimately depends on how one values the points discussed in this essay. I believe it is ultimately a benefit to the country.", "speed": 0.6817131462006689, "eta": "00h02m22s"}

One of Britain's most famous businesses and Families had a particular objection to the start of the National Lottery. The 'pool' companies and Littlewards, in particular, were particularly worried about the start of the National Lottery. They were worried that people instead of spending money on the 'pools', would stake a \u00a31 on the National Lottery instead. This was a major part of their argument, that the National Lottery would take their business away and due to this they would have no need to employ as many workers, causing an increase in unemployment in Merseyside, already an unemployment problem spot.\nCharities were worried that they would lose out. They had been promised a cut of the profits from the National Lottery, so many pence in the pound (aprox 40p) going to the charities. However, calculations showed that charities would probably lose out, collections would cease to bring in the vital funds charitable organisations relied upon. Clubs and charities who sold scratch cards as a source of income were worried because they thought nobody would buy their cards. They could not offer large money prizes like the Lottery. More worries were expressed when the Lottery's own scratch cards were introduced, possibly meaning even less money for charities.\nLarge debate centred around which organisations stood to benefit from the profits made by the Lottery. Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed. Sports teams, clubs, social groups and communities applied for cash for new facilities and then John Major announced some profits would be used for the construction of a British Academy of Sport.

These two partieswere Michael Bronson's 'Virgin' group, and another independent group, 'Camelot'. When it was decided that 'Camelot' were to run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected on the grounds that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits of the National lottery, as far as donating a percentage to good causes (such as various local support groups -ie- homeless shelters, the millenium fund, and other more prominent charities). Bronson * this was *, in that 'Virgin' would have taken no profit at all from the lottery, and all proceeds, aisde from the money given to winners of course, would have been donated to charity.\nAnother objection that was raised has that the National Lottery would create a 'gambler's society', with people becoming addicted to the thrill of * * every week throwing away their money. Indeed, this has been seen to become a problem, in that people from low socio-economic groups have spent more on the lottery than others, when they can't really afford to, because they wanted to 'get rich quick'. Linked in with this problem was the fact that young people (in the this case, under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem which more conservative groups felt was to become as great an addiction as alcohol or drugs to young people. \nFinally, the last major objection was the possibility of one single individual winning a sum of as much as \u00a340 million.

When it was decided that 'Camelot' would run the lottery, Richard Bronson objected, arguing that 'Camelot' intended to take a share of the profits from the National Lottery, as opposed to 'Virgin', which would have donated all its proceeds to charity, excluding of course the money given to the winners.\n\nAnother objection raised was that the National Lottery might create a 'gambler's society', leading people to become addicted to the thrill of spending money each week. Indeed, this has become a significant issue, with people from lower socio-economic backgrounds spending more on the lottery than they can afford, driven by the desire to 'get rich quick'. This problem was exacerbated by the concern that young people (under-sixteens) would also become hooked on the lottery, a problem that more conservative groups feared could become as addictive as alcohol or drugs for young people.\n\nFinally, the last major objection was the potential for one individual to win a sum as large as \u00a340 million. Groups such as church teachers felt that this was too much money for one person to have when there were so many problems, such as famine and homelessness, in the world. They also questioned how such a large amount of money would affect a person's life.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

Keep the original sentences where possible.\nProvide only the final essay.\n\nI think that it is possible to argue that the computer has made us both use and not use our brain more for a number of reasons.\n\tFirstly you could see that the introduction of computers has made us think more because of all the programmes used on them. It can take quite sometime learning how to use them. Besides, as soon as one programme or computer is brought out it becomes out of date because people are <?immiediately?> thinking about how to improve it. After all it was man that invented the computer. Computers can't replace the human brain (not yet anyway!).\n\tIt is possible to say that using computers do not stop us using our brains as much, they are just quick, efficient time savers. After all somebody must be glad of using a word processing programme rather than having to write or us an old fashioned type writer. What if you were to make a mistake writing an important letter? You would have to start again unlike pressing one key on a computer.\n\tPeople claim that computer games don't need a brain to be played. On the contrary some games are so difficult people are consulting together all over the world on how to do them. (And how are they communicating? By computer, which is a lot quicker efficient way rather than post or the like. I don't know about using your brain but I'd say that by working with all these time-saving, quick computers is definitely using your head.) But then there are computer games that don't need any brainpower whatsoever, just keeping your finger on a button. Now this is where computers have stopped us using our brains.\n\tDespite computers saving time, they do everything for you at the touch of a button, solve the most difficult sums, check for spelling errors on essays, letters and other documents and much more. This is why it could be said we don't use our brains as much.\n\tFrom simple things such as homework to running a nuclear power station computers do everything for you. In the control room Heyshams Nuclear Power Station it takes one man to run it. Millions of pounds worth of computers do the rest. I cannot see much brain power needed for that.\n\tComputers can communiate with each other, fly planes, build cars, they may even be running the country next.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "I believe it is possible to argue that the computer has made us both use and not use our brains more, for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the introduction of computers has made us think more because of the numerous programs they offer. Learning to use these programs can take considerable time. Moreover, as soon as one program or computer is released, people start thinking about how to improve it, indicating a constant drive for innovation. After all, it was humans who invented the computer, and it cannot replace the human brain (not yet, anyway!).\n\nIt is also possible to argue that using computers does not necessarily stop us from using our brains as much; they are merely quick and efficient time savers. For instance, using a word processing program instead of a typewriter is a relief, and the ability to correct mistakes instantly is a significant advantage. If you were to make a mistake while writing an important letter, you would have to start again, but with a computer, you can simply press a key and correct it.\n\nSome people claim that computer games do not require much brainpower. However, contrary to this belief, some games are so complex that people are collaborating globally to solve them. This shows that these games can indeed challenge the brain. On the other hand, there are simpler games that require minimal cognitive effort, such as those that only involve keeping a button pressed. These simpler games do indeed limit our mental engagement.\n\nDespite the time-saving benefits, computers also perform many tasks that would otherwise require significant brainpower. For example, they can solve complex mathematical problems, check spelling errors in essays, and handle a multitude of other document-related tasks. This automation means that we might not use our brains as much for these routine tasks.\n\nSimple examples include homework assignments or even running large-scale operations. At Heysham Nuclear Power Station, for instance, one person can run the entire facility, with millions of pounds worth of computers handling the rest. This automation suggests that we might not need to use our brains as much for such tasks.\n\nFinally, computers can communicate with each other, fly planes, and build cars, among other tasks. There is even speculation that they might be managing the country in the future. This trend towards automation implies that we might be relying less on our brains for many tasks, as computers take over more responsibilities.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

There are nowadays widespread uses for computers in all parts of society. One area which has drawn particular criticism is the computer games industry. Since the early 1980's, when computers such as the Spectrum 48K and the Commodore 64 were introduced into the homes of millions of people, controversy has followed about their effect on children. There is a widespread belief among parents that computer games hinder a child's ability to learn. The development of more sophisticated and technologically advanced computers, such as the Amiga and PC, has served to deepen the \"problem\". The growing realism of the games appeal strongly to children. However, parents feel that children should be broadening their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry is encouraging children not to learn. Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer, the calculator, to help them.\n\tAnother moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace. There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace. The role of computers is already significant in employment areas, such as accountancy, which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers. These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result. As the computers are: more efficient than humans, do not require payment for their work, are less temperamental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill, it seems mankind is faced with a great problem.\n\tAnother claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti-social behaviour. The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become unsociable. The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to, supposedly, make life easier for us.

Computers nowadays are a far cry from the one's in the past which filled whole rooms. They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds.\n\tComputers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education. But are they such a good thing?\n\tWhen calculators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations. The computer could do the same thing. Computers encourage laziness in the general public, why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you. This is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas. For instance, spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a \"spellcheck\" to correct your English, which is absurd.\n\tFor the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures. This could be argued to be educational. However, this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house. They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen.\n\tIt is said that you can meet people through computers and have `relationships'.

Several years ago the disease BSE or 'Mad Cow Disease' became quite commonplace amongst cattle. The disease incurs a mental deficiency, where the cow cannot think for itself, and slowly dies. This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB.

If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly. If cows are no longer required by the public for food, some abbattoir workers may lose jobs, and several butchers, to whom the money from beef products is a considerable percentage of their income, may be hit hard by this.\nThe politicians still say it is safe, and that they will continue to eat beef.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Scientists believe that it may not be safe to eat beef products.

The BSE problem;\nii.) The rise of vegetarianism.\ni.) BSE is a disease that has been around for some time now in many forms. It affects sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE) and humans (CJD). All of these diseases are similar in progression and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are called <?>, or protein fragments, and are tiny non-living infectious particles. They must be actively taken in by an animal (i.e. they must be eaten) to have any effect. They are very resilient to heat and so cooking possibly infected food does not help. When BSE was first publicised in the mass media several years ago, there was a huge outcry: - people were worried that they would catch the human form of the disease and so experts were brought in to calm people down. After a while, as often happens, people largely forgot about BSE, but it didn't go away. The problem was that increasing numbers of herd animals were having to be destroyed as they displayed BSC symptoms. However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?\" The government reply was along lines of: \"Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten,\" i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then a recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country. The government strenuously denied this, making matters worse, and as nobody knows the real situation or even if CJD can be caught from eating infected beef, many people would seem unwilling to take the risk. The recent headlines made by small isolated numbers of deaths from CJD have not helped either.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "The people of the U.K. would seem to be \"going off\" eating beef, and I believe that there are two main reasons for this:\ni.) The BSE problem; ii.) The rise of vegetarianism.\n\nThe BSE problem is a significant factor contributing to this trend. Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is a disease that has been around for some time in various forms, affecting sheep (scrapie), cattle (BSE), and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD). All these diseases share similar characteristics and are likely to have the same cause. The probable infectious agents are called prions, which are tiny, non-living protein fragments. Prions must be actively ingested to have any effect and are highly resilient to heat, meaning that cooking potentially infected food does not eliminate the risk.\n\nWhen BSE was first publicized in the mass media several years ago, there was a massive outcry. People were concerned about the potential transmission of the human form of the disease. As a result, experts were brought in to address people's concerns. Over time, while the public largely forgot about BSE, the problem persisted. Increasing numbers of herd animals began displaying BSE symptoms, and the issue of undetected infected animals entering the food chain raised significant questions.\n\nPeople questioned how they could be certain that no infected animals were being slaughtered and entering the food supply, given that symptoms might not appear until several years after the initial onset of the disease. The government's response that \"our safety precautions are enough to ensure no infected beef is eaten\" was seen as a vague and inadequate explanation, which only raised more doubts. A recent TV documentary confirmed that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety measures were inadequate and BSE was being distributed across the country. The government's denial of these findings only exacerbated the situation and created further distrust. With the uncertainty of whether CJD can be contracted from eating infected beef, many people are unwilling to take the risk.\n\nIn addition to the BSE problem, the rise of vegetarianism has also contributed to the decline in beef consumption. As more individuals adopt vegetarian or vegan lifestyles, the demand for beef has decreased, further affecting the market.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

The disease originally, was carried by chickens. When the farmers killed the chickens for their meat, the remains (bone and organs) were processed to provide a cheep feeding product. Unfortunately the disease carrying organs were not just fed back to chickens but to cows as well. The cows contracted the disease (in a slightly different form) and this was when \"BSE\" first came about.\nThe correct thing to do, would have been to destroy the infected cows bringing an end to a potentially life-threatening situation. However, the farmers had money involved and did not. When the infected cows were slaughtered for beef, their remains were processed and fed back to other cattle spreading the disease further.\nUnfortunately, unlike the chickens, the cattle were able to pass this disease on to humans in their beef.\nThe same industrial techniques are still used today, and with the people in the UK becoming aware of the facts and more health concious, the sales in beef have decreased.\nIt is impossible to learn that you have contracted the disease for up to seven years. And so, some attitudes of the public are: \"Why should I stop eating beef if I could already have BSE?\". Another public attitude is to ignore warnings as there have not been any victims. But it seems that the most popular option is to be safe and quit beef entirely.\nIt seems that more and more families have opted for chicken, pork or lamb as an alternative.\nIt could have devastating effects on the agricultural industry as well.

This has caused many problems not only for beef farmers, but for the economy as a whole, since the exportation of beef brings welcome finances into Britain.\nThe reason for beef consumption in the UK falling is because of \"Mad cow disease\" or BSE. This is a disease which affects the cerebral cortex of the cows brain. It is therefore feared, due to poor knowledge in the scientific world, that there is a contractable human equivalent called Creutzfeld Jacobs disease or CJD. This lack of knowledge has immediately made the public afraid, and are now turning to substitutes. This fall in demand is in turn lowering prices, and farmer are in deep financial trouble. <figure> In figure 1. we can see the original price and quantity which is demanded is much greater than in figure 2. where a fall in demand has resulted in a price cut.\nIf these falls in sales keep going, then it is possible to see many of these farmers going out of business and into unemployment. For farmers this would be disasterous. These farmer have been farming beef all their lives, and know nothing else. If farmers live in marginal land areas, then the resulting population will become unskilled, and ageing.\nI personally believe that the agricultural industry will never collapse, due to the common agricultural policy (CAP), and price support by the government. The government wants to be self-sufficient, and also keep unemployment as low as possible, so the government will start to buy up surpluses. <figure> In this situation, at price P, more is supplied, than demanded, but this intervention price means that the farmers can produce what they like, as they get to sell their surplus anyway.\nAll this will do for the agricultural industry is ensure farmers can predict their income for the next year. This is because once these \"price-support schemes\" are started, they are very difficult to take down again.\nIn conclusion, although this is a dangerous disease that may be contractable, the agricultural industry will not fall by as greater degree as anticipated.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Recently, the consumption of beef in the UK has fallen dramatically, causing significant problems for both beef farmers and the economy as a whole.

Farmers who keep a large number of cattle may struggle financially due to the sudden shift in public taste. This sudden drop in demand means that dairy farmers are likely to be left with unsellable cattle. Without demand for beef, there is little incentive for farmers to continue producing it, leading to fewer cattle available for slaughter.\n\nSo far, the industry claims that the decrease in beef consumption is due to seasonal tastes and that farmers have been waiting out low prices. However, there is no visible sign of market recovery. Eventually, the reduction in the number of cattle being slaughtered will affect suppliers of cattle materials, such as feed (if not grass feed), or services like slaughterhouses. While some government subsidies might help alleviate the immediate issues, they would only address the symptoms rather than the root cause: the public's belief in the dangers of consuming beef.\n\nIn conclusion, the media's role in spreading misinformation about 'mad cow disease' has significantly influenced public perception and consumption habits, leading to economic challenges for the agricultural industry.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

The egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father. Once fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal. Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy. This usually leads to multiple births ie. twins, triplets etc.\n\tThere are people who are agains this, saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube, as they believe life starts from the moment of conception. There are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who isn't?, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example. The people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child. Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation. Through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children.\n\tTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind. I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie.\n1. Fertility treatment should not be given to post-menopausal women. The menopause is the body's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby. Last year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation (IVF).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is the process of fertilising an egg in a laboratory setting, typically in a test tube. The egg is retrieved from the mother and placed in an environment optimised for fertilisation by the father's sperm. Once fertilisation occurs, the resulting embryo is implanted back into the mother's uterus, where it will develop normally. Typically, more than one egg is retrieved to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy, which often results in multiple births, such as twins or triplets.\n\nThere are those who oppose IVF, arguing that it is unnatural and not fair to the child who begins life in a test tube. They believe that life begins at conception. Ethical considerations also arise regarding who should receive the treatment and who should not, at what age such treatment should be denied, and whether the significant cost of IVF could be better spent on saving lives through measures such as vaccinations. Proponents argue that IVF is a fundamental right, enabling women who would otherwise be unable to conceive to have children. For instance, a woman with blocked fallopian tubes might not be able to naturally allow eggs to reach the uterus, making IVF a fair solution to her infertility.\n\nAs technology has advanced rapidly, ethical and practical guidelines have lagged behind. Therefore, it is imperative to establish certain regulations. For example, fertility treatments should not be provided to post-menopausal women. The menopause indicates that the body is no longer capable of supporting a pregnancy. A case from last year highlighted this issue, as a post-menopausal woman obtained IVF treatment by falsely stating her age.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

The sperm of the egg of the two partners are removed and they are then fused together in the 'test tube' hence the term test tube baby.\n\tAs the law stands it is possible for this treatment to be carried out in the U.K. and the first baby girls was born in 1978.

When women start menopause is it natures way of saying the body is not a suitable host to a new life? Not necessarily. Women now can have the treatment, successfully, and give birth to healthy children late on in life. Although some British doctors disapproved of such methods this treatment is easily found abroad. The desire to have children is so great mothers can pay thousands of pounds in the hope they may concieve. I find this to be a difficult issue to agree or oppose as only being young and having my life ahead it is quite easy to say that it is disgraceful women of late 50's having children and they had their chance and they let it go but if at fifty and maybe you put your career first all your life and now want a family should you not be given the chance and is it not how old you are but what kind of a mother you would be? I think that I would like to see a change in the law to allow women to have children if they feel able to cope but I feel if legalised it would be a decision taken to freely by women and not taking into consideration the consequences. At twelve years old the mother could be near seventy and is this really the age to bring up a teenager?

This issue is complex; while it may be seen as disgraceful for women in their late 50s to have children, I believe that if a woman is capable of coping and desires a family, she should be given the opportunity. The decision to allow such treatments should not be based solely on age but on the woman's ability to be a good mother. I support the idea of changing the law to permit IVF for women who feel they can handle the responsibility, provided that each case undergoes counseling and assessment.\n\nIf IVF were legalised for post-menopausal women, it would be necessary to consider the potential consequences. For instance, a mother who is 12 years old when the process begins could potentially be in her 70s when the child is born. This raises concerns about the emotional and social development of the child, including the potential for resentment, bullying, and communication issues between the child and mother. Therefore, if such treatments were to be legalised and widely available, it would be crucial to implement counseling and an individualised assessment process for each case.", "speed": 0.6492192198939383, "eta": "00h01m40s"}

Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed. People in our modern times are now able to have liver, heart and even lung transplants, there are many complications but many are succesful. People are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or, a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells. All the above are carried out on living people, but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born.\n\tBodies can start their days in a test tubes. This is called 'in vitro fertilisation'. This is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together. The test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed, the baby is then inserted back in to the mother. The fetous is left to grow and develop naturally. This idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children. An in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside, which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her, this would not happen if the couple adopted. What I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post-menopausal decides she wants a baby. Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child. The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age.\n\tAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube, and the sperm is selected, this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected. The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Science has made significant progress since the 19th century.

This is known as in vitro fertilization (IVF). In this process, an egg is removed from a woman and placed in a test tube, where sperm is then added. The egg and sperm fuse, and the test tube is incubated for several weeks until a fetus is formed. At this stage, the baby is inserted back into the mother, where it continues to grow and develop naturally. This method is particularly beneficial for married couples who have been trying to conceive but have been unsuccessful. IVF allows the baby to grow inside the mother, fostering a natural bond and ensuring the child feels part of her. This contrasts with adoption, where such a bond is not possible. However, I believe it is ethically questionable for a post-menopausal woman to pursue IVF. Nature has already indicated that she is too old to bear children. Allowing her to proceed could be unfair to the child, who might grow up with friends whose parents are in their 30s or 40s, while her own mother is drawing a pension. Moreover, the mother might die before the child has lived a full life, which would be unjust to the child. The child might also have to care for an elderly mother.\n\nAs the fetus begins its life in a test tube, the sperm selection process means that the sex of the fetus can be chosen.

Those with less money, however either have to not bother, take years saving up or adopt - but this is not the same as having your own biological baby.\n\tProblems which may arise for the parents are mainly the chances of the treatment being unsuccessful. This can be a major disappointment especially if the couple have spent all their savings on the treatment. They could even get into debt if they wanted to try again. There is the ethical issue if on finding out if the baby will be deformed or mentally ill in anyway whether to abort the foetus or not.\n\tFertility treatment in post-menopausal women is one of the most controversial issues when discussing IVF. They have their own personal reasons for why they want a baby at that stage of life. Most people disagree with it from the start without even hearing the argument from the mother. This is because they probably see it as unnatural to continue (or <?> having children when the body is not biologically prepared for it.

This allows the couple to develop their careers earlier in life, therefore, they can be more financially secure before they have children. Also, it allows women who have divorced to enter new relationships with the possibility of having (more) children which can sometimes strengthen relationships.

It would be unfair to have a child at say 60 knowing that you may be suffering from ill health in the near future and expect the child to support you.

I will also discuss the potential benefits and harmful aspects of genetic manipulation or genetic engineering.\n\tGenetic manipulation and gene technology is a vast field of study and it is growing increasingly larger, which is why we need to monitor its progress in order to limit the size of any potential damage. Scientists in this area must bear the burden of moral responsibility, simply because the high technology levels allow them to have the ability to create potential world diasasters. At the momentic it is possible to insert genes of 1 organism into another, allowing for mutations of animals with altered genes. I predict that in the near future, this will cross into human biology, and that it will soon be able to alter physical characteristics of unborn babies, as well as even psychological alteration. The moral implications of this are huge, and as it is a scientific creation, then scientists must be held responsible for their actions. An example of irresponsible behavior in this area, in recent times was the introduction of cancer cells into normal everyday flu viruses, by a team of scientists in America. The military will no doubt be involved in gene technology, and scientists must be held responsible for the weapons they will no doubt create using genetic manipulation.\n\tOf course the technology does have beneficial effects.

Genetic manipulation and gene technology is a vast field of study, and it is growing increasingly larger. Therefore, we need to monitor its progress to limit any potential damage. Scientists in this area must bear the burden of moral responsibility because the high technology levels allow them to have the ability to create potential world disasters. At the moment, it is possible to insert genes from one organism into another, allowing for mutations in animals with altered genes. I predict that in the near future, this will cross into human biology, and it will soon be able to alter the physical characteristics of unborn babies, as well as even psychological alterations. The moral implications of this are huge, and as it is a scientific creation, then scientists must be held responsible for their actions.\n\nAn example of irresponsible behavior in this area is the recent introduction of cancer cells into normal everyday flu viruses by a team of scientists in America. The military will no doubt be involved in gene technology, and scientists must be held responsible for the weapons they will no doubt create using genetic manipulation. Of course, the technology does have beneficial effects. It is now possible to grow human cartilage in the shape of an ear, which will not be rejected by the patient's body.

The research in the last decade or so has made unbelievable progress at every turn, not all of it 'morally viable', so to speak. The theory that scientists should take responsibility for their work and its consequences is an interesting idea but there is one basic function of human psychology that makes this hypothesis invalid; when an individual scientist is working on research they are almost always working under sponsorship or directly working for a company. This means that any responsibility he/she may feel for his/her actions is shifted to their employers/sponsors. This effect has been studied for many years and several well-documented experiments show the effect clearly. It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face. Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in ww2 again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentration camps and saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sense of immediacy of the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.\n\tThis is all very interesting you may say, but these geneticists must feel some moral obligation. The actual work of genetic engineering is constantly coming up for discussion in today's media world and the work of many leading laboratories has been recognised as useful and moralistic. For example the production of insulin by genetic engineering is undoubtedly a laudable use of scientific knowledge, also the production of high yield crops for third world countries, another useful facet of genetic control. But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound? For example the high yield crops; they do indeed give many times the harvest of a normal variety yet several leach the soil, require very careful use of oil based fertilisers and countless other minor adjustments.

This technique has been of great benefit to the human race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.\n\tIt is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides. This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for any later events.\n\tToday, much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work on this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.\n\tWhere scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes. These are now available in a supermarket near you, with their genes altered to increase their redness, juiciness or resistance to disease. These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe, but if they, or some other genically engineered food, proves to cause a terrible disease, than that is the fault of the scientist who developed them, because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side-effects, that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market, and the scientists are to blame.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "Genetic manipulation has been ongoing for centuries through selective breeding, both of crops and animals. This practice has brought numerous benefits to humanity, enhancing food production, quality, and variety. Beyond agriculture, selective breeding has also contributed to the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton. \n\nIt is only in recent times that genetic manipulation has been perceived to have both advantages and disadvantages. This shift occurred as scientists gained the ability to alter an organism by modifying its genes. Initially, researchers delved into the nature of genetics out of genuine curiosity and without any foresight of potential misuse. Therefore, they cannot be held accountable for subsequent applications of their discoveries.\n\nToday, significant research is being conducted on human genes to understand their functions and explore ways to prevent diseases. While scientists working on these projects cannot be blamed for any unethical uses of their techniques, such as in biological warfare or for the elimination of \"gay\" or \"criminal\" genes from human embryos, they can be held responsible in certain circumstances.\n\nFor instance, genetic engineering in tomatoes has led to the production of tomatoes that are redder, juicier, or more resistant to disease. While these tomatoes are likely safe, any future health issues resulting from genetically engineered foods would be the fault of the scientists who developed them if they were inadequately tested for safety. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medicines prove to have harmful side effects, the responsibility lies with the scientists who did not thoroughly test these products before bringing them to market.", "speed": 0.7071152870523619, "eta": "00h00m46s"}

Eventually it will be possible to eliminate genetically in herited diseases such as haemophillia and cistic fibrosis. This will be done by mapping the entire human genome. This will enable scientists to know precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.\n\tGenetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids for circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.\n\tGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a very simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need.\n\tCrops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to draught, pests and disease.\n\tIn the future it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. This is immoral as superhumans would be created for specific jobs for example huge men with lots of muscle small heads and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or for boxing.\n\tScientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal.

With this information, certain genes can be searched for in the fetus, and if detected, the diseased genes can be replaced with normal ones.\n\nGenetic Engineering is used today as a means of producing substances deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids, which are circular loops of DNA found in bacteria, along with an antibiotic resistance gene. This killed off other bacteria, leaving behind bacteria containing the insulin gene. These bacteria were then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout their lifetime. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics, making this process preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Such processes are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions, allowing people infected to lead relatively normal, healthy lives.\n\nGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective breeding is a simple example: cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together. After many generations, cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need. Crops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to drought, pests, and disease.\n\nIn the future, it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. However, this is immoral as it could lead to the creation of superhumans for specific jobs, such as huge men with lots of muscle, small heads, and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or boxing. Scientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future, which means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this from occurring. Genetic manipulation and engineering should be used to allow disadvantaged people to become normal, but not to change normal humans into superhumans. This should not include mental ability, as this would also be immoral.\n\nIt must be the responsibility of scientists to bear the burden of these advancements, as they are the ones with the knowledge to create the superhumans. Genetic manipulation and engineering should be used ethically and responsibly.", "speed": 0.7071152870523619, "eta": "00h00m46s"}

The possibilities are endless, a crop could be designed that would grow in the dry, hot conditions of many third world countries, relieving them of their worries of starvation. Cattle could be bred which are more efficient at converting plant energy to body mass or even diseased could be killed off by altering people's resistance to them. Of course to some extent genetic manipulation already exists. Racehorses are bred from certain combinations of parents and gardeners cross breed plants to suit their individual needs.\n\tHowever, their is much opposition to the process of genetic mutation. The advantages seem very favourable and I'm sure that a scientist would take much credit for these. But would he accept the blame if he caused one of the many disadvantages of genetic manipulation?\n\tThere are many possibilities for the misuse of this process. One is a question of ethics and morals. Is it right to try and change motive? Is it the right of one man to play God?\n\tIt is also possible that we would not be able to control the new organisms that would be created by genetic engineering. A new plant which has an increased growthrate may seem like an answer to all our problems but what would we do if suddenly it upset the ecosystem, draining the soil of its nutrients and not allowing other plants to grow? In theory a scientist should take responsibility for this but in an area such as genetic manipulation of which we do not know a great deal, it my not be possible to find a solution.\n\tAnother problem would be the process of testing.

Would a scientist who developed such technologies be held responsible if their work led to undesirable outcomes? There are numerous possibilities for misuse. One such concern is ethics and morality. Is it right to attempt to alter fundamental traits? Is it within the rights of one person to play God?\n\nAnother significant issue is the potential loss of control over new organisms created through genetic engineering. For example, a new plant with increased growth rate might initially seem like a solution to all our problems. But what if it begins to disrupt the ecosystem, depleting soil nutrients and hindering other plant growth? Although a scientist should take responsibility for their work, in the field of genetic manipulation, where knowledge is limited, finding a solution might not always be feasible.\n\nAdditionally, there are concerns about the process of testing.

Therefore it is far more benefical to conduct an indepth study of a single subject and find out all there is to know, than follow a brief interest into anything and everything. Because far more has been discovered since Da Vinci and Faraday there is less need to take everything as unknown and new.

The babies produced are often refered to as a 'test tube baby' because they were concieved in a testtube and not in a uterus.\nThere are two ways in which the process can be performed. The first case is if the ovum comes from the 'mother to be', this is usually because her partner has a low sperm count or is infertile; if he is infertile a donor's sperm will be used instead. The second case is when the 'mother to be' is post-menopausal or infertile, it is then that a donor's ovum would be used. It is possible that IVF would be used in a case where both these scenarios are combined ie both partners are infertile, although I suspect this may be considered unethical and full of problems.\n\tThis process is full of ethical questions and the rights of all parties, the parents', the donor's and the child's, must be thought out before hand.\nFirstly the rights of the parents; there are two opinions 1) that people should have the right to have children if they want to and if it is possible to give them that chance, they should have it. 2) that doctors of the medical profession should not have the right to play God. Problems may arise if the women was post-menopausal. Should she really be allowed to have children when her body has told ner no?

It is such speed which gives the computer processor the edge over the human brain.\nThere are however tasks which the computer cannot acomplish. A computer is not free thinking like a human and can therefore only accomplish what it is programmed to do. This could cause a great problem, for example the smallest of errors in the program would cause the computer to proceed with the wrong program as it cannot distinguish that the program has an error. It reads the program as a human would instructions and processes them.

This is obviously shown in the area of space exploration, such as the Hubble telescope.\nThe invention, however, has led to a reduction in the need for manual labour. This is chiefly shown on the production line where robotics is often used to ensure quick methods of manufacture that require no time off, sick pay, redundancy or leave to go to the bathroom.

For example, everyone may suddenly become vegetarian or tastes may alter in such a way that nobody in the UK wants to eat beef. However, these occurances, are at best unlikely. The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is.

This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead?

The so-called 'mad cow disease' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction, stumbling around drunkenly. Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further. Those cows which had been put down were not used for food. The disease infects the cow, and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain, and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat, the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take.\nThe human disease, Crentzfeld-Jacob disease, or CJD, is believed to be a human form of BSE, although no clear link has yet been established between the two. It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise, or whether awareness of the condition is heightened, but more cases, from all ages have been diagnosed recently, and the disease is always fatal.\nThe government insists, perhaps correctly, that British beef is perfectly safe to eat.

The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time, this being a viral disease. It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers. The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating, e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on. However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef.\n\nAnother reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB.\n\nThese factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell.

After a few reported cases of CJD, a similar form of the disease found in humans, it is know thought that 'mad-cow disease' (BSE) is the cause. Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans.\nThis claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness. Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 %.\nAlthough scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef. customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some 'dodgy' butcher trying to cut costs. As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu. An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant. An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "result": "There has been a significant scare in Britain recently regarding the potential contamination of beef with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), which could lead to the human equivalent, CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease).

Also failure for the U.K. to eat beef would mean that no beef would be purchased abroad and so the industry would suffer extreamly. And furthermore the fall that Britain isn't importing beef means that other countrys would'nt want to import UK beef because there is no tradeing between the countrys. This would also mean the change from Beef farming to crops or pig farming which would mean the clustering of all the cows and then wastage of this meat. The industry would also require heavy government subsidys to start the industry running again and for the diversifying by previous beef farmers.
