When he returns to Argos, he cannot feel a part of the city for the simple reason that he is innocent, and feels innocent, whereas all those citizens born in Argos and living there, have supposedly been born into guilt. The whole point of the play seems to be an attack on the Church and religion (especially Catholic) which holds good considering Sartre's atheism.\nThe whole city of Argos is in perpetual mourning and repentence for a murder which happened unbeknown to many of them: for those who were around, guilt is theirs for not having prevented the atrocity. The Queen's mournful clothing and black funereal make-up emphasize the point: there is no happiness in the city. They are all allowing themselves to be ruled by the past and, in fact, seem to be in a time-warp, not moving forward, not even seeing their futures. All the features Sartre placed in the play show an exaggerated set-up of the real world and its religion. The fact that religion tells us we are guilty because we are human and we live governed by the murder of Christ which happened unbeknown to us, but we must still repent this sin. A significant attribute is the plague of flies around and in Argos, to enhance the picture of being totally enclosed and \"attacked\" by something which Sartre implies is all in the mind. This ability to shock his audience was an attribute he found very powerful and positive, in that he was thus guaranteed their attention and a reaction. Here, he has even placed a god \"on earth\" as it were, as if to prove that they are in fact no greater than us and the fact that they can produce miracles, has no bearing on their power over us and does in no way justify our servitude under them.","num_words":339}

Firstly, Clarence is guilty. His previous life as a lawyer in Paris was led in a sense of 'oneness' and false innocence. From the moment Clarence hears the scream on the bridge, which triggers his mind into recalling and recognizing various incidents of his 'fall', he realizes that this previous life was in fact a guilty one, a duplicitous one - his image in the mirror now seems double - because he did not recognize the essential nature of the human condition and was leading a life which on the outside was that of a 'do-gooder' whereas he primarily carried out his good deeds for his own satisfaction in being able to control other people. <quote> he maintains. In order to overcome this guilt at his former duplicitous nature, he then tries to overtly demonstrate his double character, by leading a life of self-satisfaction and debauchery. Still unable to rid himself of his guilt he goes to Amsterdam, the scene of the Nazi atrocities and therefore a suitably 'guilty' place, to perform his newly created role of 'juge-pénitent' in which, in order to exorcise his guilt, he holds it up to everyone else, and exposes it, to then be able to regain the sense of superiority he lost, and be able to judge them.

The way in which he portrays Caligula shows the perversion of the attributes expressed in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\" as desirable. although he in many ways epitomises the Absurd man, as Camus describes him, Caligula's way of dealing with the discovery of the futility of life is a warning of acting in an absolute way. Cherea is used by Camus as a counter-balance to Caligula's absolute nature, and although he is not illogical, he realises the value of life and is therefore suggested to be right.\nFollowing the death of Drusilla, Caligula has learnt the true nature of man's existence: <quote>. Man's mortality is now painfully clear to him, as is the futility of his life. And so Caligula has understood the absurdity of our condition; the fact that we can never possess the world and never have full clarity leaves him with a sense of anguish. However, unlike Sisyphe, in \"Le mythe de Sisyphe\", Caligula is unable to accept his situation and therefore can find no happiness in it. Throughout the play, Caligula's reaction to the discovery of the Absurd is to try and carry out the impossible, thereby changing the nature of the universe, and making man mortal and therefore happy. This is symbolised by his quest for the moon, and he tells Helicon right at the start of the play, <quote>. This theory is quite logical, the impossible possession of the moon would reverse the nature of the universe and could therefore change man's condition. However, the reality is that Caligula can never make man mortal, and so unable to avoid death, he becomes death.

This is especially true of the main theme: that life is futile and yet worth living to the full. The main themes dealt with in Le Mythe de Sisyphe are the absurdity of life and suicide.\nCamus starts by trying to define the absurd. He takes this as the starting point for this work, and criticizes other philosophers for not realising the potential of the absurd and always using it as a conclusion instead of the starting point. Absurdity occurs, or starts to occur, when an everyday object suddenly becomes stripped of its everyday meaning. Camus writes that people need 'clairvoyance' or lucidity. People want and need knowledge but he shares the Cartesian view that the only thing you can be certain of is 'I think, therefore I am'. Knowledge of somethings is beyond the reach of the human mind. The disparity between the search for fundamental truth and what we can be certain of, cannot change.\nThere is a process which leads to the creation of the 'absurd' man. First of all, an object is suspended from its every day meaning. Then, suddenly, in the middle of an every day task, the meaning of what you are doing is suddenly withdrawn. The futility of your act suddenly becomes all too apparent. Camus describes the way in which you realise time is passing, and experience self hatred for not doing more with your life. When you strip life of the meaning which we usually chose to give it, every act, becomes futile. Camus describes the solitude and isolation of the realisation of the absurdity of life as being a <quote>, like a light that doesn't shine.\nHaving had the realisation of the absurdity of life, Camus writes that some people try to deny it, by taking a leap of faith.

He also has a false sense of freedom. Up to now he has been like a 'free spirit', he has made no real choices and has yet to realise his project.\nThrough the first part of the play Oreste shows signs of innocent bad faith. It is innocent as he has no past experience. He believes that people are predestined: <quote>. To Sartre there is no predestination as we control our destiny by the choices we take. Oreste also feels that he could find his past here in Argos. This is again innocent bad faith as we can not acquire an essence by assuming a social role. Furthermore he believes he could develop by taking over in Argos.\nOreste therefore starts off in a position of bad faith and moves throughout the play from this negative denial of consciousness (en-soi) to a position of authenticiy with freedom of consciousness (pour-soi). This transformation is symbolised by Electre's acceptance of him as Oreste her brother and not Philèbe. What primarily inflences him and helps to change him is seeing the bad faith of others in the play. The people of Argos are deluding themselves to escape the anguish of individual freedom and responsibility. They are like objects which are unchanging and are determined by external forces. Their present and future is also determined by a past event - their alleged complicity in the murder.

Guilt is implicit in the account, due to the fact that it is focalized through the form of a confension, by Jean-Baptiste Clamance, an ex-parisienne lawyer, however it is also implicit in various subtilties throught the play, and alludes to the universal guilt of mankind. Clamance introduces himself as a \"juge-pénitent\", these term is not clarfied until the end of the novel, and it demonstrates Clamance's tendency to judge people, his desire to feel superior to other people and to apportion guilt to those he encounters.\nClamence's former profession as a lawyer seems to back up this theme. It meant that he was in a milieu of guilt, since he was defending people guilty of crimes, or trying to prove people guilty of crimes. His profession gave him a feeling of superiority. In the court he often felt superior to the judge and he enjoyed the satisfaction he got from looking down on people and judging theme. Guilt and judgement are inherent in the legal system.\nIn Paris, Clamence led what he thought was a happy and satisfying lilfe. He enjoyed helping people because of the satisfaction it gave him.

This focalisation means that eventually it is left up to the reader or audience to decide whether they have any sympathy or admiration for Caligula.

From the death of Drusilla until his own death, Caligula his aware of the mortality of human beings and therefore feels the futility of human existence.

The country of Illyria in Central Europe is ruled by a Fascist Regent yet he is not the target for political violence. Indeed he is the object of Hoederer's attention, Hoederer being the leader of the socialists.

He believed that people should be educated in order for the state to run smoothly. ie: he did not really believe in the right of people to be educated just in the need of the state for people to be educated. As most of the population were involved in agriculture at that time, there was only need for a very basic primary education for the majority of people. This he left mainly up to the church as he believed the church would promote social cooperation. Secondary and Higher education were more important as the would train the professionals which the country needed, and this section of education was therefore run by the state. At this stage we can already see the opportunity for a gap between primary & secondary education which remained in fact until relatively recently, despite attempts at reforms which I will go into later. This system of education did not lead to much social mobility as the children from poorer social backrounds left school after primary, \"ecole primaire\", with a very basic education, whereas the children from richer backgrounds could go on to secondary and higher education. These \"bourgeois\" children would then go on to Lycée and either to University or \"Les Grandes Ecoles\" so joining the class of the élite. This elitism has survived to a certain degree up to today. \nThe gap between primary and secondary education became a major concern for the later governments.

The fact that the men in the society left to fight meant that the number of births was reduced greatly. This was also the case on the return of the men, when many did not come back having been killed. Therefore after the first world war the population of France decreased greatly.\nImmigration was already present at this time, and helped to make up for the large number of losses in the war. Slowly the population began to build itself up again until the beginning of the Second World War. In this war France did not suffer as many casualties and deaths as in the first world war, but the fact that there had already been losses made the situation grave for France. The economy needed rebuilding, as did the whole country, and the work force was very depleated. There was an urgent call for immigrant workers to come to France, and indeed they did come (about 4 million).\nWhen the troops came home, and families were reunited there was a great increase in births. The previous Malthusian attitude that less children meant a better life and greater security was replaced by a new attitude that in order to create and rebuild France a strong workforce was needed. Having a child was regarded as an 'investment in the future'. The french realised that a defeat was due to the fact that they were not a strong nation, and they wanted to build such a nation.\nThe gouvernement also adopted various policies to try and increase births in the society.

Furthermore, the French union movement is not organized according to professions as in Great Britain, but along lines of ideological stance, which gives it a different role altogether. The French unions were not, for a long time, concerned with representing the immediate material interests of their members, but in fighting long-term battles which they hoped would bring about a better and more just society. The CGT (Conféderation Générale du Travail) the largest union with ca 1.2 million members (it claims more) has always had strong communist affiliations, and has constantly been hostile to cooperation with the patronat, seeing its role as the destruction of capitalism. The CFDT (Conféderation française démocratique du travail), has a more reformist stance, and the FO (Force Ouvrière) has a more co-operation nature.\nPerhaps due to the ideological extremism of the CGT, perhaps through fear of losing jobs, or of opposing a very authoritative patronat, union membership in France has always been weak, representing at the present time only 15% of the workforce. Thus we begin our discussion of the Fifth Republic.","num_words":275}

In France unionisation has proved to be very weak and generally unsuccessful and this seems to reflect the Socialist political parties, whose underlying predudices and differences make them divided and unstable too.\nWhen the socialists came to power in 1981, the Trade Unions hoped to gain a lot. In the Auroux laws of 1982\/3 the socialists looked to sorting out the \"code du travail\" whose laws had barely been implemented especially due to the large number of Petite et Moyenne Entreprise which existed. They changed about 1\/3 of this \"Code du Travail\" giving greater protection in the workplace for the worker, rules on disciplinary matters publicised and checked by the Ministry of Labour, and increased freedom of expression. Completely against the TU's wishes, and before the 1986 elections, the Socialists made redundancy easier to give and were trying to make the working week more flexible.\nTrade Unions were legalised in 1884, although they were not allowed to form meetings or have a place on the factory floors and public services, including railways were at first forbidden to unionize. However they had to wait until Nov 1968 for trade unions to be given a legal status in factories and work places. This came after violent and extensive strikes during May 1968 when it is said that approximately 100,000 workers striked, frightening employers into changing attitudes. \nThe main Trade Union group is the CGT founded in 1895 and very closely attached to the Communist party (PCF). It advocates industrial action and membership of the PCF is  a large aid in being a member. Then there is the CGT-FO (conféderation générale du travail-force ouvrière) which was a break-away from the Communist CGT in 1947. The 3rd biggest party is the CFDT (Confédération française democratique du travail). This is a group form in 1963 when the CFTC broke up as it had become too radical for many of its Catholic members. The CFDT is connected with the PS (Partie Socialiste) although it is the least eager to appear as acting as a back-up for politics.\nBesides these 3 groups there are many other Trade Union formations in France - their large number meaning weakness and low membership.","num_words":371}

Despite this limitation de Gaulle and his followers were able to shape the new Constitution largely according to their own views as to what would constitute a strong and durable republican regime. Debré, for example, was impressed by the British model; parlementarisme rationnel meant that the Government is not at the mercy of Parliament, yet is ultimately answerable to it and thereby be forced to resign.\nDe Gaulle, however, was the main inspiration of the Constitution. His experience of 1940 made him realise the need for strong, determined leadership from the top. Before the war this was greatly lacking.\nThe majority of articles relevant to the Presidnet in the 1958 Constitution were largely similar to those under the Third and Fourth Republics. Despite this, there were several new powers introduced and listed in Article 19 including, for example, Article 11 - referendum, Article 12 - right of dissolution and Article 16 - emergency powers.\nThere were, however ambiguities and certainties in the text which have proved very significant in determining the President's role in the 5th Republic. The role of the Prime Minister was such that he had powers and responsibilities in respect of government policy that could be seen to overlap with the President's function to mediate (arbitrage) between contending groups to ensure the smooth running of the country, assigned to him by Article 5.\nThis was open to varying interpretation. The maximalist interpretation was generally accepted. This meant that the President, instead of being limited to the 'domaine réservé' ie the powers attributed to him under the Constitution, he was justified by virtue of this article in intervening in policy-making and its implementation.\nThe President was also independent in carrying out this function: he was not accountable to Parliament by virtue of ARticle 68 and not even directly accountable to it via ministers or the Prime Minister for their 'contreseing'(countersignature) was not required by him.","num_words":356}

But during a recession, as followed the oil crisis in 1975, their demands would be ineffective and membership would drop. This is what happened in France.\nMembership fell as the unions were deemed ineffective in securing worker demands. The unions has always been political in nature which limited their membership, and once membership dropped, those members who were left tended to be those who identified with the unions' political views, which restricted union aims still further.\nBefore 1968, unions were not legally allowed in the workplace in France and there were few negotiations. The little there was was at a general and regional level, far removed from the average worker's demands, and this did not help the falling membership numbers.\nEmployers tended to be suspicious of unions and did not see them as a valuable means of worker representation. This was because the great majority of firms in France were small family concerns which had sprung up in the 19th century - the PME (petites et moyennes entreprises). The boss was seen as a patriarch who should not be challenged.\nThe period of industrial relations in France under the 5th Republic can be divided into three periods. The first is 1958 to 1968. During this time the State was highly interventionist in its approach to the economy, regulating pay and price levels and investing in and developping the economy.

From 1791 to 1958 France has known 16 constitutions and since 1875 3 Republics. The 4th Republic was characterised by a weak government and a weak presidency, with power being concentrated in the hands of a divided National Assembly. The collapse of the 4th Republic and the mounting problem of the Algerian situation brought back to power the charismatic figure of de Gaulle who was seen as the only person capable of dealing and solving the Algerian problem. In his years in exile de Gaulle saw France humiliated by her defeat and subsequent occupation by the Germans, ruled by the notorious Vichy regime and, after the end of the war, still not in control of her fate, having to align herself with the United States. France was \"the sick man of Europe\". De Gaulle saw this sickness as a result of the role and authority of the state being undermined and on coming to power in 1958 de Gaulle was determined to strengthen the state and create a strong Executive, which he hoped he would lead. His importance in shaping the 1958 constitution cannot be overestimated and, though it can be said that it was tailor-made for him, it would be truer to say that the constitution became more and more tailor-made for him as a result of constitutional amendment and changes in political life. On drafting the text two conflicting notions had to be reconciled. De Gaulle favoured a return to the old Bonapartist tradition of the President having full, almost, omnipotent powers but others fearing this style of power concentrated in the hands of just one source wanted the government to have more power. A compromise was reached in which power would be shared by a strong Executive comprising of a president and a cabinet headed by a Prime Minister responsible to Parliament. De Gaulle ended by strengthening the Executive in favour of the presidency and his interpretation of the most ambiguous word in the text, \"arbitrage\" has been untouched for more than 30 years.","num_words":364}

De Gaulle's Bayeux speech and subsequent centrings made it clear that a clearly visible president was required, who would be the 'keystone' to the parliamentary régime. The constitution of 1958 honoured this, by placing the President first among the members of parliament.\nThere is however a fundamental difference between the powers that the constitution and those who drafted it gave the President and the powers that he subsequently acquired. The result is a very interesting example of how circumstances and personality can change the constitution.\nThe constitution had originally left policy and decision making to the prime minister and his government (articles 20-23). The power granted under article twelve to dissolve parliament would, according to Michel Debré, only allow a short exchange with the public. According to the constitution, the President was only to assume the role of constitutional dictator in times of grave trouble (art. 16). In a brilliant exegis of the constitution he had authored in large part, Michel Debré said that the role of the President was to be that of an arbiter, to oversee the constitution, and be 'beyond politics and the political parties. \nThis seems to have been somewhat unrealistic. Neither the war in Algeria, nor, despite appearances the personality of de Gaulle would let him be the arbiter of the constitution. \nThe referendum in 1962 gave the President the legitimacy of the public vote. Now he was directly answerable to the people.\nIn 1964 Charles de Gaulle realistically defined his role as President. He was still prepared to play the role of arbiter when absolutely necessary. According to him he was the head of Parliament and no other institution either social or judiciary was higher than him. He saw parliament as 'sitting around him'.","num_words":320}

First that the presidency had been strengthened and secondly that the executive had been strengthened vis-à-vis the parliament.\nI will briefly discuss the Prime Ministers role and then elaborate on the Presidents functions. Then I will analyse each presidency showing how the presidents role has evolved.\nIn the constitution it is not very clear who exactly is in charge. Some articles clearly suggest it is the prime minister who is in charge while past Presidents and prime ministers have claimed it is the president. Some argued that there should be a twin-headed executive but in the past prime ministers have always accepted Presidential supremacy.\nThe constitution says that the Prime Minister is in general charge of the government. Certain function have been clearly listed eg. The appointing of ministers. However this function has been usurped by the president, along with certain other functions.\nGiscard d'Estaing when asked what the prime minister role was, replied that the prime minister was in charge of contingency problems whereas the president was in charge of what was permanent and essential. He was clearly violating the spirit of the constitution but was merely reiterating what was practiced and preached by his predecessors. So the role of the prime minister remains a controversial issue.\nThe role of the president is defined in the Constitution but is rather ambiguous and controversial too. Article 5 claims that the president is an \"arbiter\". This is rather ambiguous. Does this mean he plays a neutral function, as he is an impartial referee and stays away from the making of policies or does it mean he must intervene and play an active role?\nThe term 'arbiter' is sufficiently vague enough to allow presidents to interpret it as they wish, and this they did.

Matters had come to a head in 1958 with the uprising and unrest in Algeria. De Gaulle had outlined his plans for the constitution in 1946 with his famous speech at Bayeux, but he had slipped back into the shadows of the Fourth Republic, annoyed at the lack of attention being payed to him by the French and the victorious allies who did not like his authoritarian style of leadership and negociation. By 1958, the country needed De Gaulle and the referendum passing the new constitution received an 85% 'yes' vote. This was in sharp contrast to the apathetic 53% vote on a 35% second turn out which had marked the start of the Fourth Republic. The new constitution of the Fifth Republic aimed to separate the legislative, executive and judiciary, with the powers of the executive not stemming from the executive. If there had been any doubt, which of course there had about exactly where the power lay, then De Gaulle by his very actions soon began to show who was in charge.\nThere are several bones of contention about the definition of the Presidents fonctions. Firstly article 16 grants the President special powers in times of national emergency. However there is no distinguishing criteria for what constitutes a national emergency. In 1961, De Gaulle used these special powers. The cause of the time of emergency according to De Gaulle was in Algeria but this was strigently debated at the time. It had been thought that De Gaulle was rather abusing these special powers.","num_words":302}

The President was given the traditional powers of the Head of State as well as becoming the 'chef cérémoniale de l'Etat', a similar rôle to that of our Queen, and as well as becoming the Chief of the army.\nHe was given a lot of power through articles such as 8, 12 and 11 of the Constitution as he didn't need the 'contreseing' of the Prime Minister or other ministers responsible. It was with Article 8 that the main ambiguity arose. It gave the President the power to name the Prime Minister but it remained ambiguous whether he also had the power to sack him. De Gaulle used this to his favour and after appointing Michel Debré in 1958 he was forced to withdraw from this position in 1962. De Gaulle saw him as a good Prime Minister in war time but after the Algerian war he decided he no longer had any use and effectively sacked him. In choosing Georges Pompidou in his place de Gaulle illustrated also that the choice of Prime Minister was solely his. This interpretation of Article 8 was a cornerstone in the development of the President's power. In choosing initially Debré, de Gaulle set a precedent in that he created a 'domaine reservé\" for the President in which the Prime Minister was not to interfere. The President was to deal with long term issues especially foreign and defence policies whereas the Prime Minister was to deal with the short term domestic issues. This autocratic and authoritarian rôle of the President evolved throughout the 5th Republic. Pompidou, after having been Prime Minsiter for six years carried on dealing with economic, domestic and financial policies.\nArticle 11 was not in itself so ambiguous. The President could put important decisions to the people by referendum. De Gaulle used it in 1961 to ask the French whether they thought the Algerians should decide their own future. In 1973 Pompidou used it to see whether there should have been an enlargement of the European Community as the British wanted to join under Heath. However, here Pompidou was able to use Article 11 for tactical reasons, to divide the opposition.

Demographists claim that it is a major factor in considering the problems of that country's evolution - for example, it is thought that many of France's problems during the twentieth century have been caused by a premature decline in the birth rate in the nineteenth century, and the consequent ageing of the population.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century France had the largest population in Europe, after Russia, and was also a major world power. Since this time, both its power and population in relation to the rest of Europe, have been in steady decline. By the beginning of the first world war, France's population trailed far behind that of Germany, which was one reason why Germany felt confident of victory. During both World Wars France not only lost thousands of men, but the birth rate also dropped dramatically. During the economic crisis and depression between the wars, the birthrate was also low, because it was a time of gloom and pessimism, with little hope for the future, and so people couldn't afford large families.\nThe consequence of these factors was that by the end of the second world war, the adult population in France was greatly reduced. It was at this time that the birth rate suddenly increased, with the Babyboom. Between 1946 and 1964 the birth rate increased 20%. - this was due to decreasing infant mortality, the introduction of social security and familly benefits, a new optimism for the future, and an abandonning of former Malthusian attitudes, in favour of a more dynamic outlook. The birth rate had in fact, begun to increase before the end of the war, as people took on a care-free attitude, with little feeling of responsibility.\nAt the same time, the death rate was decreasing, due to advances in medicine, and living conditions. This meant that the number of old people was steadily increasing. So, after the war, there was a reduced number of adults, to look after, and produce goods for, a increased number of children and old people. This, and the need to build the economy, led to the influx of immigrant workers into France, with has in turn led to many of today's problems with immigrants.","num_words":388}

At that time (1959) most children stayed at primary school, only 35% were progressing to secondary education (the sixième year). Berthoin was the first minister of education to address the problem of democratization. He tried to prolong school life for a large number of pupils by making education compulsory until the age of 16, abolishing the entrance examination to the 'sixième' and abandoning the 'classe de la fin des études', where children stayed at primary school until 14. He introduced the concept of orientation and observation, whereby a pupil could be directed towards the school mostly suited to his needs (the prestigious lycée and the College d'Enseignement Général), whilst trying to bring the two schools closer together. The lycée had always been the bastion of élitism, with its Napoleonic tradition.\nIn 1963 Fouchet created the College d'Enseignement Secondaire, a lower common secondary school, to try and encourage upward social mobility.

The education system needed immediate modernisation and democratization. The first reform which aimed at achieve these was the Berthoin reform which was issued by decree under de Gaulle's emergency powers with no opportunity for parliamentary debate.\nUnder this reform, the school-leaving age was raised to 16, thus ensuring a longer span of education. A cycle of observation of 2 years was introduced for pupils at the age of 11, the idea being that during these 2 years pupils' progress would be observed and at the end of the cycle each pupil would be guided by teachers into either the lycée or the CEG (collège d'enseignement général) as best suited the individual. Berthoin hoped this would reduce social discrimination since all pupils would follow the same syllabus. However, this cycle of observation took place in different institutions - the lycée, the CEG and the primary school - and little transfer of pupils actually took place (1% of pupils transferred to the lycée on average). In these institutions sylabuses were harmonized but this was inefficient and insufficient as far as equality of opportunity was concerned.\nThe Fouchet reforms of 1963 sought to relieve the continued dissatisfaction of the political Left, primary teachers and trade unions by improving on the Berthoin reforms. Fouchet tried to introduce a common middle school for all pupils - the CES - which would cover the 11 to 14 age span. It was to be formed by converting the junior classes of the lycée into separate units and by transforming the CEG's. At the end of the CES, entry to the lycée would be by the pupils carte scolaire not by exam. Lycée teachers feared a drop in standards, and middle class parents feared tougher competition for their children. Hence conversion was resisted - in the opinion of the Legrand report, the CES never actually came into existance. However the CES such as it was did provide for an increased equality for pupils but the biggest drawback was the streaming system - the 3 filières, of which filière number one had the bad teachers and was dominated by children of the middle class.

However, Voltaire's aim is not to move but to amuse. he writes the tragedies in such a way that they bring laughter to the reader rather than tears. The Narrative side takes second place as Voltaire concentrates on the philosophy he is trying to put forward.\n\tIn order to tackle the question of philosophical optimism in Candide, Voltaire has to prove his philosophy of rejecting the doctrine of optimism or at least trying to slow it down. Thus, he begins the story by making Candide agree to philosophical optimism and listen to his tutor, Dr. Pangloss who preaches it. Then as the story progresses, the changes in attitudes and thoughts can develop, resulting in the way Voltaire believes.\n\tVoltaire aims to persuade the reader that the doctrine of optimism is not a valid one. Everything that happens in this world is not for the best according to Voltaire and there is too much suffering in the world for everything to be so positive. Voltaire uses suffering in order to criticize the doctrine of optimism. The story is one continuation of suffering and tragedy to the characters.","num_words":347}

In this conte Voltaire savagely condemns the doctrine of optimism; the notion that all is well in the world and that events occur as part of some Divine Purpose. Voltaire rejects this theory of optimism on the basis that there is so much evil in the world and this optimism is subject to great satire throughout 'Candide'. Voltaire presents optimism through the use of Pangloss who religiously adheres to this 'detestable principle' and he contrasts it with the pessimistic views of Martin and by showing many atrocities and evils in the world of which the conte provides an abundance. \n\tIn 1775 an earthquake struck Lisbon killing 40.000 people or more and this severely shook Voltaire's view and faith in God. Voltaire thus began to question the theory of optimism presented by Alexander Pope 1733-4 in his 'Essay on Man' that 'whatever is, is right': Voltaire asked: why do men suffer under a master who is just? Finding no answer, Voltaire rejected the principle of optimism- that logic and reason could somehow explain away the chaotic wretchedness of existence by ignoring the facts. Indeed the question of philosophical optimism is subject to much attack and satire in 'Candide'.\n\tVoltaire tackles it by juxtaposes this doctrine of optimism with the evils in society; rape, pillage, murder, massacre, hanging, storm, disease, earthquake, theft, prostitution contrast the theory that 'tout est bien dans le monde' which heightens its travesty.\n\tIn 'Candide' the character of Pangloss has the aim of representing this ridiculous 'philosophical optimism'. Pangloss believes that there can be 'no effect without cause' and he comes under great satire by Voltaire for adhering to this 'thoughtless optimism'. Pangloss taught 'metaphyisco-, theologo-, cosendo-, nigology'; 'nigology' is a made up word which shows that his teachings are a fraud and therefore Voltaire disreputes optimism. At the beginning of the conte Candide naïvely and innocently believes Pangloss as he is not 'really listening' but is more interested in the beautiful Cunégonde. Throughout the tale, the various characters  open Candide's eyes to reality and he soon rejects Pangloss's theory of optimism in favour of a practical philosophy of hard work and common sense.","num_words":385}

He is a proffessor of metaphysico-cromonologigie, a ridiculous name for a ludicrous subject. Throughout the book, whever there is a disaster, Pangloss fondly proclaims that in the best possible of worlds, everything is for the best! An example of this is when he is explaning to Candide how he caught the pox, a terrible venereal disease that can make people sterile and send them mad, he explains its genealogy and states that originally one of Colombus sailors caught it in the New world and brought it over to Europe. This, according to Pangloss was a good thing as Colombus also brought back cochineal and chocolate, without his trip those items would not have been available, and so it is worthwhile having the pox!\n\tVoltaire highlights the ridiculous nature of l'optimisme by putting is characters into truly awful situations, and then letting Pangloss expound his nonsense. The characters encounter rape, pillage, war, natural disaster, disease and separation and throughout the novel Pangloss never falters in his assertion that everything is for the best. Candide, however, the main character, slowly begins to appreciate that such a philosophy is nonsense.\n\tCandide starts out as a naïve young man 'avec les moeurs les si douces' who idealizes Pangloss and his teachings and attempts apply them in his life. He suffers a series of misfortunes which painfully teach him about reality. He is evicted from his home, a castle in Westphalia for having fallen in love with Cunégonde, who has enticed him to behave badly. His love for Cunégonde is a mirage, he is in love with an ideal which contrasts sharply with what we know about her expedient virtues.

The target for the wit is the theory of eternal optimism which was profounded at the time by Leibzig. However it is not just a clever and amusing tale around the 'tout est bien' philosophy but a critical assessment of the doctrine. Voltaire showed his displeasure of the 'all is for the best' theory in his poem after the Lisbon earthquake where grieving victims were indeed told that their grief was needed to continue the general scheme of the world. Voltaire mocked them by  saying that the  masons would probably be celebrating as they would earn a great deal for rebuilding the city, or the heirs to large fortunes would be glad as they would now receive their inheritance. Voltaire described this philosophy as the only possible horror which could be equal to the earthquake itself.\n\tIn 'Candide', it is our hero's tutor, Pangloss who subscribes to Leibzig's theory even though he sometimes confuses it. We meet the 'tout est bien' principle in the very first chapter where Pangloss attempts to explain his beliefs with some basic examples such as ears were given so that spectacles would sit on them properly. Pangloss then expounds on this theory throughout the tale, sometimes with a callous coldness.\n\tThis is exemplified when Candide, Pangloss and Jacques the Anabaptist, Candide's benefactor are sailing to Lisbon. Jacques is drowned in a shipwreck while saving an ungrateful sailor. This 'brutal de matelot' survives together with Pangloss and Candide. The injustice of the situation is clear to all but Pangloss showing no sympathy consoles Candide by saying that it had to happen at that time off the coast of Lisbon.\n\tVoltaire is in full flow now with incident after incident which stretch the reader's credulity to the limit but also go to show the farcical extremes to which Pangloss will go to justify his theory. Voltaire uses the Lisbon earthquake to make the same point which is outlined above when the real earthquake occured.\n\tThe plot then goes into a ridiculous level. Candide is whipped and Pangloss is hanged at a magnificant auto-da-fé which was held so that similar earthquakes would not strike Lisbon again. Candide then begins a series of adventures without his tutor, first with Cacambao and then with Martin, an eternal pessimist.","num_words":383}

It is essential to Rousseau's argument to see natural man as innocent and independant and as inherently good. When he was alone and dependant upon no-one he was equal to his fellow man, it was only when man discovered the ability to co-operate with other men , to work together and thus found the basis of a civilization did man's corruption begin, leading to social inequalities.\n\tRousseau places man's development in five seperate stages. The first is the stage of man's innocence when he is dependant only on himself and in stark contrast to civilized man he is free from corruption. The second stage man forms a social unit of 'family' as he builds himself a dwelling and becomes protector and father. This is the 'golden age' from which man is ousted due to the desire for self-improvement. This leads to the development of the concept of property as man who has become a cultivator needs to protect the land he has cultivated from others, and so makes a statement of owning it thus leading to a horrible state of war (as Hobbes said) 'of each against all'. The final stage is the establishment of a 'social contract' in order to secure peace for everyone and to escape the perpetual state of war.\n\tThis is the development of man into society from a stage of equality into a life of human inequality.\n\tRousseau looks at 'man-made-man' and sees how he is dehumanised when compared with earlier man.\n\tThe social development which occurred when men desired self-improvement led to man being capable of advancement due to science and scientific knowledge but as  Rousseau said, 'these supposed improvements were the source of his misfortunes'.","num_words":382}

Rather than taking it to pieces and destroying it bit by bit, Voltaire takes completely the opposite stance and builds up the philosophy of Pangloss to such ridiculous extremes that it cannot possibly be taken seriously.\n\tVoltaire creates series of great human suffering brought on both naturally and by mankind, then in the middle of it all Pangloss starts his philosophising that these incidences are good and for the best making the incongruity of it all particularly striking. When Jacques drowns for example Pangloss restrains Candide from jumping in to rescue him by saying that the Earthquake and shipwreck were supposed to happen specifically for the purpose that Jacques might die here in Lisbon harbour.\n\tAnother example comes earlier on in the novel when Candide, having escaped from the Bulgars meets an old 'tramp' on the road, only to realise it is his old master and teacher Pangloss. The Baron's home and family in Westiphalia have been destroyed and Pangloss is ravaged by syphilis contracted from Paquette, yet Pangloss remains optimistic and positive, there is no despair.

He has been widely acclaimed as the witiest and most perceptive authour of the 'roman philosophique'. In Candide, he tells the story of the young hero's travels throughout the world in search of happiness. On his travels the naïve boy becomes a mature man. Many of the episodes that the characters are put through in the story are outrageous and extravagant. They serve to keep the reader's interest and to give a cynical comentary on the world through Votaire's eyes. \n\tThe main motivation of the novel,however, was to launch an attack upon a popular philosophical theory of the day: optimism. This doctrin of divine providence carried many prestigous names in its list of followers, such as that of John Locke, a very influential English philosopher of the period. Optimism stated that, as the world was created by god, ,who is a perfect being, all that happens in it must be for the best. All individual suffering must be attributed to the general good.\n\tVoltaire's experiences and knowledge did not allow him to adopt this theory. He had been in Lisbon, for example, when a terrible earthquake destroyed the city and killed an estimated 50,000 people. How could such a terrible disaster possibly be 'for the best', and how could the deaths of so many people contribute towards the general good?\n\tIn the novel, the young Candide accepted Optimism as an unshakeable theory when he was taught it by his tutor, Pangloss, whom he described as the best of all tutors.

It is in the course of this journey that Voltaire shows us how abhorrent the climate of optimism was to him, an optimism which often was simply an excuse for the lethargy of contemporary society.\n\tThe story begins with Candide comfortably installed at the mansion of Baron Thunder-Ten Tronkh. Here, he is taught the philosophy of optimism by Pangloss, whose maxim is: \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possible'.\n\tAt the mansion in Westphalia, Candide falls in love with the beautiful Cunégonde, and because of this love he is thrown out of the house and forced to wander. He does not however forget what Pangloss has taught him, and naïvely beleives in this philosophy almost to the end of the book. Candide experiences many things which would make anyone else turn away from the philosophy of optimism but he goes on vainly beleiving that  \n\t'Tout est pour le mieux'.\n\tFor example Candide is pressganged into joining the army and here he witnesses a bloody battle, where each side claims to be the victor having caused immense damage, and supposed heroes no worse than marauding rapists. Having survived this battle Cunégonde moves on through to Holland, where he meets again his friend and teacher Pangloss, who is almost dead of the pox, which he caught from Paquette, who in turn had traced it back through a long line, including several churchmen. Pangloss himself, although in this sorry state, still maintains his optimism, and together they journey to Portugal. Here once again they suffer terribly, first of all their friend is killed by a vicious sailor, and they arrive in Lisbon to find it in the midst of a terrible earthquake which kills many thousands of people. Somehow Candide manages to conclude that this must be part of some divine plan, although he is possibly beginning to have some doubts.\n\tHis optimism is however renewed on his arrival in South America.

He was not necessarily against Leibniz, Shaftesbury and Wolff even though he ridiculed their standardized terminology, but utterly opposed the perversions of this doctrine which offered the contrary. Such perversions turned this philosophy of hope into one of despair.\n\n\tVoltaire used pessimism as the main stream of attacking the philosophical doctrine of optimism. In this he includes suffering and misery which abound in the book.\n\n\tMartin is the character which Voltaire uses to represent pessimism, the view that man was made evil and therefore seeks to do evil and that everything that happens is for the worst. He enjoys bursting the bubbles of the hope of Candide who only lives for this ultimate happiness - that of seeing lady Cunégonde again. It is this hope which helps him to complete his life long journey.\n\n\tConversly, the character of Pangloss represents the optimistic theory - 'all is best in the best of all possible worlds where everything is connected and arranged for the best'. He was Candide's tutor, who stood by this doctrine, in spite of all his sufferings - his own hanging, flogging and dissection. Such thinking angered Voltaire that good always comes out of evil particularly since the recent events of his day distrusted him so greatly - a disaster such as the earthquake at Linis and Lisbon in which thousands of people perished. How can that contribute to the common good?\n\n\tEvery character involved in the book has endured much suffering including Candide himself. In a sense, he was blinded by following the illusion of the love of his life, lady Cunégonde, who he planned to marry one day. Voltaire presented her as an object of desire, the only reason why Candide continued on his journey but when they eventually met, Candide was greatly disappointed. She had changed in beauty and personality, she had become unbearable to live with.

He believes that inequality (and also vice) only developed as society did and attempts to show this in his 'Discours sur l'origine de l'inégalité'.\n\tRousseau believed that there were 2 forms of inequality : natural or physical inequality and political or moral inequality. Natural inequality is, as its name suggests, given by nature and has always existed, though not always been noted while moral inequality has various sources. Natural inequality occurs because people have different strengths, looks, talents or gifts. These lead to notions of beauty, merit,...to jealousy & conflict. Such observations of inequality would not have occurred in the state of nature because man rarely met and no comparisons were ever made.\n\tHowever, as the numbers of men grew, he spread further, men began to mix more often and developed a sense of moral obligation. Once men lived together, their emotional capacity grew and differences ie, inequalities began to be noted with the beginning of sexual inequality due to a sexual division of labour. This is how simple society developed & the first man who enclosed a piece of land & said \"this is mine\" developed the property law and thus civilised society. Inequality hardly existed in the state of nature but grew as our faculties,  experience of the human mind did so & was established & legalised by the introduction of property & eventually laws.\n\tAlthough inequality already existed this was the 'golden age' & would have continued indefinitely without further development. Man was free & happy while he was independent but unfortunately the division of labour and specialisation made people interdependent & (made labour necessary). This led to the invention of agriculture and further specialisation with various jobs being worth more, earning more. Economic inequality had led to wealth inequality, divided the world into the rich and the poor. Differences in wealth brought about further inequality in rank & social esteem which affected the power one had in society.","num_words":364}

One of the most dominant being that of Optimism.\n\tThe idea of Optimism is represented by the philosopher Pangloss who preaches his philosophy at every turn even in the face of adversity. His belief is that everything is for the best, even the death of two hundred thousand in the earthquake at Lisbon is deemed as God's will and for the good of mankind. For Pangloss every cause must have an effect, for example at the beginning of the story, Cunégonde dropping her handkerchief, led to Candide kissing her and therefore the beginning of his path of misery. Pangloss' philosophical optimism is something which is unobtainable, the good in the world does not necessarily make up for the bad. Pangloss is a pedant, remaining true to his philosophy without considering anything else.\n\t Throughout the narrative Voltaire subtly attacks the idea of Optimism, as first put forward by Leibniz in 1721. He does this by showing the illogical traversity of it which Pangloss parrots throughout the story and jutaxposes it with a catalogue of diasters and human suffering eg\/ rape, pillage war. Candide travels and search for Cunégonde and by extension happiness is tested by every possible means. At first Candide determindly follows Pangloss' theory of Optimism, but towards the end begins to doubt it and finally rejects it after meeting the Negro slave in Surinam left lying naked at the side of the road, with an arm and a leg missing, by his master.

Since the Single European Act 1986 the completion of such an open common market ( ie one free market for Europe with no trade barriers) can now be seen as a reality. However, even though Britain has joined the European Communities and accepted its affects through the passing of the European Communities Act 1972, there  has arguably been a very high price paid. This of course is the loss of absolute supremacy for the English Parliament.\n\t\tThe Orthodox theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy states that Parliament cannot restrict it's own legislative omnicompetence. That is, Parliament today cannot pass laws which limit tomorrow's Parliament's legislative powers, be they restrictions on manner and form, or as in the case of the European Communities Act, restrictions on subject matter. Inherent in the founding treaties as amended is the idea that European Community law must prevail over national law. Therefore, in the case of a contradiction between the two, European Community law must be abided by. This first aspect of Britain's membership of the European Communities has thus already shown a restriction on Britain's legal system : that of the doctrine of implied repeal. The court's view of this argument is of utmost importance; however the judges have not had to decide this point as yet. The orthodox Lord Denning has described Britain's Accession as a \"farewell to our sovreignty\" on the one hand and yet on the other hand he has said that theoretically conferred powers can be retained, even though in practice it would be virtually impossible.\n\t\tThe radical theorists would agree that it is \"farewell to our sovreignty\" completely.

This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of \"1992 and all that\". A single market requires one central institution to co-ordinate all movements of goods and policies.

It is obvious that this would lead to a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as indeed for all the other member states, and that is to say that there would be a loss of national government power in favour of a central European institution of policy making. This would cover four main areas of British society, i) economic, ii) political, iii) defence, and iv) legal.\n\t\tAs far as economics is concerned, British independant economic policy would be undermined, primarily as being in a monetary union with other states would lead to a loss of the exchange rates as a method for controlling the flow of goods in and out of Britain. The British government would no longer be in a position to devalue or revalue the pound, to regain competitiveness with our European neighbours. This could mean Britain becoming an unproductive backwater in Europe. The Bank of England would also loose the right to print and distribute an independant currency, ie. the pound, and the British government would loose power over all monetary  policy, as there would be a single European exchange rate, interest rate, and inflation rate. This is because the supply of money would be controlled by a central European bank, having jurisdiction over these variables. This would render Britain with only fiscal policy to control her economy, but there are even rumours that this may also be centralised in a new Europe, embracing everything from tax policy to social security payments.\n\t\tAs a natural cosequence of this, there would be a political loss of sovereignty, because if there is no way that British instructions can exercise their power, they may as well not exsist.

The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all ? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\n\t\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factors. Firstly, was Europe's realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were economically, militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states. Secondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had both begun as European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \"integration\". The 1970's saw progress in integration, with the introduction of community policy instruments, which enabled greater scope for national policies.","num_words":385}

Its potential as an organisation is huge. With over 312,000,000 inhabitants, it will constitute the largest single market yet to have been created, its gross product being equal to that of the United States and double that of the Soviet Union. As the title implies, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in Britain towards fuller integration with Europe is the belief that it will imply a loss of sovereignty for the elected government. In the course of this essay, we shall attempt to analyse whether this is a belief founded in reality and, if it is, why it should cause such fear.\n\t\tThe Single European Act can be analysed according to three broad areas. Firstly, it reaffirms the Treaty of Rome's original aims - to remove all internal, physical, technical and fiscal barriers, creating one external frontier with uniform standards and rates within the market. Secondly, it reallocates the powers as they were laid out by the Treaty of Rome, abolishing the right to veto in the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, it recognises the position of the European Council (not originally included in the treaty), gives the role of foreign policy creation to the European Policy Corporation (EPC), changes the voting procedure for the Council of Ministers and makes the European Parliament a directly elected body. These are quite significant changes and are aimed at facilitating the transition from the partial integration which exists at the moment into fully integrated economic and monetary union.\n\t\tBritain's reputation in Europe on these issues is not an enviable one. If her image in the foreign press represents any kind of standard, she is seen variously as the most obstructive, bellicose, insular power, thwarting the path of progress, with Margaret Thatcher, the most insular Brit of all, at the helm.\n\t\tPerhaps it is not an unfair image. Although Margaret Thatcher is no longer leading the country, the position of most British politicians on the European issue appears extremely ambiguous. Very few members of parliament are willing to openly and unreservedly affirm their support for the idea of a fully integrated Europe.","num_words":382}

The fact that the concept of a single market is itself very hard to define has been the source of much confusion and some hostility towards it from the British public. A great fear of losing our sovereignty has stemmed from the varying theories of what \"1992\" entails, and from many people's wish to remain ignorant of current developments.\n\t\tThe most evident implication of the single market is, in my view, the abolition of trade and customs barriers. This will apparently extend our free market economy to the whole of Europe, or at least to those countries who participate. The consequences of the lifting of these barriers can be viewed positively or negatively : for British firms which rely on international trade to survive, the single market will be an incentive to increase dealings with other European firms. In addition, it will be more convenient to move goods across frontiers - especially with the eminent launch of the Channel Tunnel for public and commercial use. However, it can be argued that firms in the British economy will suffer from European competition, or even dominance. Also, if a single European currency is ever introduced as part of the process, it is thought that European firms will have a new incentive to \"buy British\", as the formalities required in foreign exchange will no longer exist and the UK's current balance of payments situation may even improve as a result. Similarly, British firms might look for new products in other countries if they are no longer constrained by tariffs, bringing more diversity to their product range and therefore enhanc?? profits.\n\t\tBut the question of the single currency is itself a subject of much controversy. I believe that it is an aspect which is more threatening to British sovereignty than the general concept of the single market. Somehow, the prospect of treating Europe as one market is more acceptable if the countries participating keep their individual currencies and hence their identities. However, the idea of all the states using one currency is generally regarded as being a much greater threat to sovereignty, and would mean, to many people, the sacrificing of their pound to suit the aims of the Europeans.","num_words":387}

As she is not formally connected to the Continent as such, but is an island, the vanity of british nationalism is apparent. The British will find it very difficult to take orders from another governing power from the continent (and after all it is still called \"the Continent\" - as though it were a separate entity).\n\t\tThe obvious advantage is the far wider market open to British industry and a bigger jobs market. \nBut one section will suffer. It is those firms which up to this time would be depended upon to obtain imported goods for Britain. This would all change because of the introduction of the ECU - European Currency Unit - a planned single currency within Europe. Firms buying components from abroad could easily purchase the goods with the ECU if it is successfully brought in, or otherwise they could use their own currency without having to pay such things as import tax. But I feel the British would resent the use of ECU - taking away the pound would be taking away part of Britain's own identity. Is it why many British people are slow to educate themselves about the future plans, despite the fact it is being hailed as a great step forward ?\n\t\tWith the mergence of all the individual markets, paper-pushing will be reduced as there will be no more exchange controls with a single currency and the bureau de change will also become redundant.

They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force. A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that, for example in military matters, the central government spoke for all. It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states, but no-one would challenge the fact that, on matters external to the United States, the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body.\n\t\tIn Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force.

This represents a loss of sovereignty as Parliament is bound to a certain extent in that Parliament is obliged to legislate under the constraint that if does not the UK will be in breach of its international obligations.\n\t\tParliament's freedom to legislate is not in theory fettered by such a Treaty. An Act of Parliament is enforceable by British courts even if it is in breach of Britain's treaty obligations. However in interpreting statutes the court will wherever possible interpret so as to conform with international law.\n\t\tThe EEC however is a distinctive Community compared with other international organisations in that it has its own broad executive and legislative powers and judicial powers for creating and enforcing Community Law, for example Regulations made by the Council of Ministers, which are directly applicable in all member states. In 1963 the European Court of Justice stated that \"... the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law, for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only member states but also their nationals\". The whole point of Community law is that it should not be overridden by domestic legal provisions of the member states.\n\t\tThe Community legal order is thus inconsistent with the orthodox view of the doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy and sovereignty.","num_words":302}

This major target is to be attained by the removal of all fiscal, technical and physical barriers. This means that a merchant or tradesman would be able to sell his goods in any community country, an individual would be able to borrow and deposit money in the banks of any member state and also work in any member state with national qualifications. There would also be the introduction of a European passport and an integrated transport system.\n\t\tDespite the fact that the proposals put forwad to amend the Treaty of Rome came from an Englishman, namely Lord Cofield, there has been widespread dissatisfaction in Britain regarding the single market, shown by frequent discussions in Parliament and letters to leading national newspapers, whereas Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission described the measures adopted as a mere compromise.\n\t\tIn accordance with the Constitutional Law of Britain, Parliament is the supreme law-making body in the United Kingdom. Consequently the emergence of another source of law, deemed to be supra-national is inevitably a problem. One of the prerogative powers conferred upon Parliament is the right to make treaties. However these treaties are not directly effective on British individuals, so that where a treaty contains provisions giving rights and duties to an individual, he cannot place reliance upon the treaty until it is substantially incorporated into the law of the United Kingdom, by an Act of Parliament. This acts as a curb to the enforcement of European Community Law, so that to a certain extent, a degree of sovereignty is retained. Yet, this is not as advantageous as it may at first appear, for there exists a general judicial presumption that Parliament does not intend to legislate contrary to European Community Law.\n\t\tPersonally, I think that although the integration of Britain into Europe will be beneficial in so many matters such as freedom of transportation, movement, work and many other realms, there are also many disadvantages in store, including the loss of sovereignty to a certain extent.","num_words":378}

The 1972 European Communities Act and the Treaty of Rome have as their aims the eventual unification of the nation states. Hence the fact that there is no clause in the Treaty detailing how a member may leave. The treaty bound Britain to certain measures which have already curtailed our sovereignty. For example, the European Commission (an unelected body) can issue resolutions which do not even need to be incorporated into the domestic law of each member state - they are directly applicable. How has this affected our sovereignty ? Until 1986 each member had the power of veto so that no new law could be passed without full agreement. In a way this did not affect our sovereignty. The Single European Act of 1986, however, introduced majority voting. It is now possible, therefore, that the UK opposes proposed legislation but that is voted through by the other states and becomes law here without our consent. This is obviously an infringement of our sovereignty already.\n\t\tA unified Europe, though, could be expected to have a more representative legislative body, although there is no guarantee that we will not be in a minority then.

Instead, the Press has tended to focus on a new role for business people, students, holidaymakers even, but not really, the average person on the street.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe will entail a loss of sovereignty, to some degree, for all the countries of Europe. But the extent to which this happen depends on the role and the power of the european Parliament. There are already many proposals under way for breaking down the frontiers between countries and perhaps, a single currency, so this of course would help promote a European identity. However, if the European Parliament plays a role similar to that of today, that is, power to enforce some legislation, but acting more as an \"advisory committee\" for the Member parliaments, then there will not be a great loss of sovereignty. The breaking down of barriers, etc, will be seen as merely an extension of the E.E.C. and nothing more. But if the majority of legislation were to come from Brussels, then I think the British would feel a great loss of sovereignty and even resentment.\n\tObviously, a united Europe is not going to erase centuries of culture to form one identifiable \"European culture\"; but this might always be a worry for the British, (and probably, for other countries too). Thus a loss of power for the British Parliament would probably be seen as the first step of this \"merging together\". Nevertheless, one should not forget the role of the citizens. If they do not want to \"become European\" then they will not do so. They would have to respect the European Parliament, but in every other way life could carry on as normal.

As there is no written, or codified constitution in the U.K., which has a higher status than that of ordinary law, Parliament can theoretically make or unmake any law whatsoever. In the words of the known jurist Dicey : <\"     \">. All this shows that, by the orthodox, traditional approach, as it is considered impossible to bind subsequent governments as to the procedure or manner and form of legislation, it is impossible for entrenchment of statute to occur. Unification would by implication involve a universal european adoption of common laws, in order to provide compatibility between the individual constituent nation states, and in order for those laws to be recognized by the courts of this country, these laws would need to be adopted in the U.K. in the ordinary way, ie. by enactment of Act of Parliament. Those adopting the orthodox viewpoint would see this as a \"loan\" of sovereignty rather than a \"loss\", for they would claim that by the theory of parliamentary legislative supremacy the U.K. might seize back this sovereignty by repealing the european statutes, in the ordinary way.\n\tIt could be claimed that the U.K. made its first steps to unification when it joined the European Community (E.C.) by the enactment of the European Communities Act 1972.

Other European nations are divided down into smaller federal regions, as is the case in Switzerland. In fact Britain has been one of the few European countries not to favour an electoral system of proportional representation. This implies the British prefer the idea of a single government, united in policy, reflecting the interests of a supposedly united nation. Of course such a vision is a false one. Nevertheless, such an image makes any loss of sovereignty to such a nation more keenly felt. The current and recent British governments have been at odds with the more common political stance in Europe, the British one being right-wing and individualistic. In particular Margaret Thatcher and Nicolas Ridley (rather tactlessly, in his case) opposed a complete alignment with Europe.

With the granting then of independance to the colonies Britain was restricting her sovereignty, for which special Acts had to be passed to enable her to do this, but Britain has always retained absolute sovereignty over our own destiny.

There is a conflict between federalist nations like Germany and those who wish for a more loosely structured Europe and slower reforms, which seems to be the view of our present government in Britain.\n\tThe fears of European federalism which are expressed by many of our leading politicians and legal figures stem from the idea that the sovereignty of our Parliament is paramount. This view of the legislative supremacy was expressed by Dicey who wrote that \"...quote...\". Problems arose with Britains accession to the European Communities in 1972. By this Act Britain was argued to have limited its legislative competence in certain fields were it had handed its sovereignty to Community Institutions. However the doctrine of parliamentary legislative supremacy meant that the British Courts were under a duty to apply the legislation made by the British Parliament. This has led to two interpretations of Community Law with the European Court of Justice consistently ruling that Community legislation must be applied uniformly throughout the member states.\n\tHowever the argument goes beyond these doctrinal questions. Many people are worried about the lack of democratic control over the Community decision making process and the voting systems used to enact legislation. Another problem is the intention of the Community organs to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of its Member States with a view to promoting the development of Europe as a whole, and in particular reducing the disparities between  the various States and in particular those with the weakest economies, for example Italy. This means legislation must be adopted to further these aims and this means that by joining the Community Britain has undertaken to implement necessary legislation within its sphere of influence.

Legislation takes place in the European institutions by ministers and MEP's from all sorts of countries, so a certain loss of sovereignty is involved for Britain. Concern is therefore understandable.

This economic union will not really create a loss of sovereignty for Britain, as it will merely aid the exchange of goods throughout Europe. However, the fears are that the act will lead to decisions being imposed on Britain since an important element of it is the commitment to majority rule rather than the previously common practice of consensus decision making in the council of ministers. This would result in the ability of individual nations to veto key decisions being restricted.\n\tBritish sovereignty could be in danger if this union led to a European government imposing its authority on Britain. A centralised European government would inhibit Britains decision-making ability. The recent incident of the european Parliament imposing its ideals on Britain points out the authoritative principles to which it may be forced to accept if such a strong central body was created. It believed that Britain ought to halt construction on the Channel Tunnel link due to environmental concerns, however this action seemed to be an imposition on Britains sovereignty as an external body was trying to tell the country what to do. If the European Community was to bring in a single currency, Britain may be deprived of its sovereignty since it will lose its individuality, but more importantly would forget its bargaining position on the foreign exchange. Currency decisions would be made by a central body which Britain would have to accept. \n\tIf a single Europe should lead to British troops fighting on behalf of Europe instead of its own nation, most sovereignty would be lost.","num_words":382}

Simply signing the treaty meant members were already pooling their sovereign rights in certain areas.  Resistance to joining from inside Britain and from inside the Community itself was centred around the argument that Britain was already enjoying favourable trading conditions with the U.S.A. and with the countries of the Commonwealth.  As the EEC assumes ever greater proportions the debate, particularly in Britain, is centred around a potential loss of sovereignty as the member states look to integrate further.\n\tParliament is no longer the sole source of English law.  As Britain continues to sign treaties, the regulations that are entailed in these treaties become directly applicable to the U.K. - that is without the interference of Parliament.  The Single European Act has given rise to more majority voting in the European instititions which means it becomes increasingly possible to introduce legislation in the U.K. to which no one here has agreed.  Certain rules of community law regarding rights and duties are directly effective.  It has been made quite clear that the courts are to apply the rules as if they were Acts of Parliament.\n\tIt is increasingly the case that Parliament legislates so the end result or the legislation is as desired by the Community.  The Community was quick enough to remind the Italians that a new legal order had been created and that pieces of community law would be directly applicable.  In short the community was reminding the Italians of the degree of transfer of sovereignty.\n\tHowever, the current European writer Collins while maintaining his support for community law and discretion is in favour of the power of Parliament to repeal the 72 Act that made Britain a member.  Lord Denning too agrees that if Britain wished expressly to repeal the E.C. Act then we could and would do just that.  The present situation can be referred to as Parliamentary self denial.  That is to say for the moment it accepts the output of Brussels but as Lord Scarmann reminds us the E.C. has force of law in Britain only because Parliament says so and he too is of the opinion that if Britain should for whatever reason want to disassociate with the Community then we could.","num_words":399}

It is such a political powderkeg, especially for the Conservative Party - which seems to have divided itself into the two distinct factions one for and one against closer integration - that it led to the resignation of Margaret Thatcher who attempted to \"bully\" her Cabinet and Parliamentary Party into supporting her undoubtly \"Europhobic\" views.\n\tIn my opinion, a single Europe in a political sense would both be disadvantageous for Britain but also unworkable because of the mix of opinions and cultures that the E.C. contains.  This would mean that there would probably not be a large enough number of M.E.P.s of a particular persuasion for a single group, be it Socialist, Centre Right or Christian Democratic to hold a stable majority.  This would lead to coalitions being formed, out of necessity, across ideological boundaries which, as we have seen recently with Italy and Belgium, would lead to unstable and ineffectual governments.  A perfect example of both the effect of coalition governments and also the lack of agreement of E.C. members at the moment on such crucial issues as Defence and Foreign (ie extra-European) Policy could be seen during the Gulf War : Britain was running low on stocks of ammunition for certain types of guns and artillary in the build up to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, so it asked one of its European Community partners and NATO allies, namely Belgium, to sell it some of its stocks.  Belgium, under the premiership of Wilfred Martens refused despite the fact that Britain among others was engaged in an operation to combat the naked aggression of Iraq against its tiny neighbour, Kuwait - and what's more : the operation had the full backing of the Security Council of the United Nations.

The importance of\ndrug testing outweighs the impairment of the right to privacy and there\nis no other reasonable alternative. The article also states, <*>. The\narticle also points that drug testing does not infringe on athletes'\nright to privacy because the tests do not come as a surprise. Athletes\nare notified in advance that they will be tested.

Although it is likely that most Americans, if asked, would profess to the belief that equal work deserves equal pay, equality of work as defined by specific task, physical difficulty, or cognitive difficulty, is not the real issue. The real issue, in a discussion of relative contribution to society, involves our deeper cultural assumptions about values of various societal functions, including non-productive (in financial terms) work.\n\nChild care work makes a good example for this point. Americans profess to value children, spending time, money and thought on such concerns as education and child safety laws. Our national education system is a pereniel subject and topic of debate in the media. However, as a nation, Americans have not reached a level of conscious acknowledgment that labor performed in the child care industry is valuable labor. If we consider that our society rewards valuable labor - valuable contributions - with first, economic measures, and, second, measures of status, then the child care worker may reasonably be judged as not providing a \"valuable\" contribution to society.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine, however, a society where workers are encouraged to take employment seriously - to say nothing of finding satisfaction from employment - and where the work force is filled with a diversity of willing workers, without considering the fundamental value of child care providers. If we recognize that a work force filled with such diversity of workers will inevitably include women - of all ages - as well as man with family responsibilities, then we see the undeniable economic connection between this \"low value\" contribution of child care providers, and the economic strength of the nation. It is not difficult to conclude that child care workers are underpaid, and the issue will be difficult to resolve without  involving employers or the government in the child care industry - which may not be the ideal solution. It is tempting to conclude with the proposal that we, as a society, consciously work to raise the status of workers who care for children - but the final irony is that, until the financial status of these workers becomes more equal, they will not be judged as making a valuable \"contribution to the society they live in.\"\n","num_words":390}

The amount of that financial reward, unfortunately, has become equated with worth as a person. However, most of the traditional household roles formerly performed by women exclusively (but now handled by people of both sexes) have never been compensated by the dollar. This poses a problem, since undoubtedly those at-home tasks contribute services to society equally valuable in comparison to marketplace \"jobs\". Therefore, in order for society to fully acknowledge the value of both types of jobs--in the home and outside the home, some sort of compensation should be made for \"home-making service\" as well as for he or she who works outside the home.\nThe career with a capital C is traditionally seen as the route to performing a service to society worth rewarding with a paycheck. Certainly doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs contribute invaluable resources to human civilization and deserve to be compensated for their labors. Teachers, engineers, artists, politicians and all those who enrich our lives and our cultures, and on whom we depend, are indispensable to society. Whether they be male or female has no bearing on the size of their reward; \"equal pay for equal work\" is a well-worded and time-honored phrase.\nBut what is \"equal work\"? It is fairly easy to establish equity between marketplace jobs with duties and responsibilities that are roughly similar. That is, a teacher of sophomore high school English and a teacher of senior high school English perform comparable tasks and therefore should be equally compensated. But how do we compare raising a family of four children over a period of twenty-five years to the job of an neurosurgeon over the same period of time? I know of no culture on this globe that pays a woman (or a man, for that matter) a yearly salary of $50,000 for nurturing and educating children from the cradle to near-dependence.

Perhaps, one might say, that the \"desire\" for money could be gauged in comparison to evil acts committed, but the wealthy would be immediately privelaged in such a formula. Desire cannot be measured on some utilitarian scale of pleasure. It increases and decreases with the acruement of wealth. The wealthy in fact could be more gluttonous than the poor who would seem to have a greater desire for financial gain. I contend that the saying is meaningless-or a least impractical - for summing up the woes and corruption of humanity since desire-much less evil- cannot be appropriated objectively and wheighed against financial aptitude. \n\n\"Happiness\" as a psychological idea can be shown to exist (in as much as \"happiness\" can be defined) among all classes, wealthy and poor. Usually those who fit the term are financially stable and so there is reason to suspect a general trend towards virtue in affluent households if happiness (as I would define it) can also be viewed as a lack of desire for further money, a contentedness with all that one has. What if not that is happiness?\n\nThe problem, however, becomes immediately clear. The desire for money would-must- coincide and flourish with a desire for virtue if virtue, here defined as the counterpart of \"happiness\", is to thrive. Only the serrendipitously rich, the heirs of fortunes, could be the do-gooders of a world where in which money was the \"root of all evil\".

A mother nurtures her helpless infant. All of the members of a family will normally protect, provide and nurture its own. Absent a deviation from our general nature to propagate and extend ourselves through our offspring, the concept of egalitarianism is a natural choice for the family unit.\nSociety also has social institutions & practices in order which preserve the egalitarian concept.

If a person gains $100 in a jewelry store theft, yet uses ten dollars worth of gas to get away, cuts his hand on a broken window and pays $50 in medical bills, and spends another $50 for a hideout hotel room, then his crime has actually left him ten dollars in the hole. \nHowever, the question of crime paying requires a deeper level of \"pay\" than simple dollars and cents accounting. In terms of criminal work, pay must be weighed as gains made from crime versus all manners of loss that occur as a result.\nOne issue to consider as a loss is the type of capital loss illustrated above. Crime, like any small business, requires an investment. One investment is time. If the time involved in the planning and enacting of a crime does not pay off in a gain that can justify that time expenditure, then the crime has not paid. Whether or not crime pays in this instance depends on how much money a criminal could make in a legitimate field. If the criminal can only expect to earn minimum wage in a legal job, then crimes can earn less to justify time spent. If a criminal is well educated and could function in one of the professions, then his crimes must earn more.\nOther capital investments in crime could include equiptment such as get-away cars, dynamite, weaponry, and disguises. Mafia and police pay-offs could be involved. Dealing in stolen property or other contraband could require splitting monies earned with other involved parties. A crime's income must be enough to cover all these expenditures.\nAnother type of loss to be considered is loss of mental or physical health and well being. Many times violence is a part of crime. The cost of taking a gunshot or knife in the leg is more than just the medical bills. It could be an injury that keeps someone from ever working again. Very few criminals have worker's compensation. The stress that comes about from constant risk of injury and incarceration is a cost in itself, and could lessen both a person's life span and enjoyment of life.","num_words":378}

Parents of would-be miscreants point out the error of the young person's ways with variations on the theme: crime does not pay. They reinforce this message with restitution or punishment that outweighs whatever payoff may have been associated originally with the crime.\nIf, however, crime does not pay, then why does it persist? Behavior that is not reinforced in some way will not persist. For whom is there a payoff? I recently read that the average amount of time that a convicted murderer spends in prison is 15 years. It seems that a more cold-blooded statistician than I am could calculate how the crime of murder might be cost effective if the only cost is 15 years of incarceration.\nCrime seems also to pay for some less violent criminals.

Long ago the quest for fulfillment of these needs took up of majority of each person's day. In order to feed your family you had to plant. In order to live you had to build. To have clothing, you had to sew. Each hour of each day was devoted to meeting these needs. Even in early times the harder you worked, the more food, shelter or clothing you gained.

We have many machines to held us meet our food, clothing and shelter needs with little or no effort on our part, it would appear. Persons with great technical minds are using their talent on the job and paying someone to do their labor.

The stock market was experiencing a boom, and several formerly working-class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early. But several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites; they received money, but they contributed nearly nothing to society.\nPeople who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill, some sort of excitement that money cannot buy. Having almost unlimited wealth changes people, both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on. But do they have the right to live this way?

A rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault (or bad luck).

In fact one needs only to consider the historical context, the current material gain, and even the consequences of crime in America to prove that crime can be a profitable profession.\nThroughout history crime is a recurrent theme, often praised as the years pass and events become more distant. Consider the vents shaping America's early history: the people involved in the Boston Tea Party were certainly breaking the law when they dumped private property into the harbor, yet this crime became a rallying cry for the American Revolution. Even Benedict Arnold's actions were considered criminal only because of the date on which they occurred. In more recent history, criminals have often become celebrities and profited after they were formally accused -- Divine Brown, Oliver North, and Joey Buttafuco are a few examples of this National Enquirer brand of fame. Likewise, events which reside in the darker portions of this country's history have often brought profit to those committing illegal activities. Prohibition provided income to thousands of people who broke the law daily while running speak-eases or transporting liquor across the border. Of course one cannot forget that the city of Los Vegas was founded  on ill-gotten gains. It seems that those who say that crime does not pay have not read their history books recently.\nThe most obvious reward in committing a crime is the monetary rewards gained from the illegal activities. No one can argue that crime is not a means of making money, if it were not why would people commit them. Yet in America we see those who are found guilty of crimes profiting from them, where but in the \"land of opportunity\" could a person find convicted killers autobiographies on the best-seller list or highlighted as a movie of the week.

For the most part when a criminal is faced with the prospect of losing his or her freedom the resulting emotion is remorse and sorrow. This is also true when the criminal is faced with the victims of the crime, the result of this realization is sometimes as emotional, if not more, as the loss of the one's own freedom.

What I mean by this is that if one looks back into the history of the feminist cause, the reason that women banded together was for recognition and equality, not for exclusivity. Nowadays, both \"feminist\" and \"feminism\" are dirty words because the cause has been misused by people who want women to be dominant rather than equal.\nSusan B. Anthony originally led the cause because she felt that women should be given equal treatment in society. The ideas behind \"feminism\" were rooted in the ideal that all men, and women, were created equal and therefore should be treated so in the society in which they chose to live. Men had the exclusive rights to the vote, employment opportunities and other societal features that empower a human being to be innately whole. by this I do not mean that by receiving the right to vote and having a chance to get a good job you have found the meaning of life. Rather, the more people that feel comfortable that they have a say in how their life turns out, or is lived in general, the healthier the society. After all, if people feel comfortable with themselves they are more likely to feel comfortable with the people around them, which reduces conflict.\nThe concept many people today have of a \"feminist\" is that of a big chunky lesbian who hates all men. This is hardly the case. But, what has happened with the feminist cause is that many radical women have used it as an umbrella. If women can shout at the atrocities that have been thrown upon their gender and call it feminism then they can get away with it. If women can tell everyone that females should be the dominant gender and all men should adhere to their wishes and call it feminism then they are home free. Consequently, the feminist movement has become a shelter for the radical women to get angry under, to shout from and to feel safe within. Outsiders now see the feminist movement as a bunch of whining women, who don't want equality but want dominance.","num_words":367}

People normally associated with politics, religion, or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences. This tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary. This is especially true of the Women's Liberation Movement in America.\nSince its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, Women's Liberation has been met with adamant, and often obstinate oppostion. Some of the first radicals, Susan B. Anthony and George Sand (although French) were noticed and ridiculed, thus defeating their cause, because of their aggressive action. At the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement. This ignorance of other less aggressive feminists, made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild, disgruntled zealots and was therfore, detrimental to the good of society.\nAlthough \"radicals\" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards, the problem still exists. From the very beginning the Women's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle. However, I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement, but rather, in the perception of those observing the movement. \nWhen Women's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s, it was again destined for failure. Immediately, the focus was on radicals like Stein, instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself. Those outside the movement could only see the differences between \"normality\" and Women's Lib.\nThis is still true twenty-five years later. Women supporting equal pay for women and and other \"liberal\" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra-burning, anti-shaving leaders of the 1970s. The good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals.\nSo what am I getting at?

We hear the word \"battle\" used often when we read of the suffragates, those women who sought out their equality, labored for years to gain access to the political system, and finally won the right only after the power structure of American politics (a male-only bastion) heard their battle cries and acknowledged their determination to achieve equal status.

However, since the original subject is <*> I will have to disagree with this statement.\n\nIf money were the root of all evil, we all would have to be evil because we all have money. Some have more than others; some have less than others. Most money is attained in honest ways: through employment, investments, inheritances, and many other lucrative means. When money is accumulated by these means, it seems incorrect to say that money is the root of all evil. If one is attaining money honestly, how can honestly be associated with evil?\n\nIt is true to say that money is the root of some evil. People have lied, cheated, betrayed, stolen, and even murdered to attain money. These actions are evil and because someone wanted money, or wanted more money than they had, they resorted to evil to attain it.\n\nOther things as well can be the root of evil: attitudes, morals (lack of), greed; there is an endless list of things that can become the root of evil. The love of money can indeed produce an attitude of dishonesty, a lack of morals, and greed.\n\nIf money was the root of all evil, then the many agencies, groups and programs that we have in America and around the world would not be able to function without the donations of money from those who are able to give. I have to agree that many times these worth-while causes are sometimes being used to satisfy an individual's greed; but I am sure that most if not all funds donated are used for the purposes intended in those agencies and programs which are reputable.\n\nIn conclusion, the root of all evil is the choice of the individual: will he choose to be morally decent, or will he choose to be evil?\n","num_words":335}

Once ones basic and comfort needs are met, what's next, power or the power to influence. This begats the will for more power and the cicle goes on. Unless the individual has a good work ethic and good sence, the power can become intoxicating to the point of it being the obsession that controls a person's life.\n\nAnything that comes easy most probably won't be as appreciated or valued as something that comes with effort. Money makes things happen, and quickly. If one has to work hard for their salary, they most likely will spend it more wisely than if someone always had plenty of money and never had to work for a living.\n\nThis brings up another theory of how people use money. Some use it to live and others live to use it. Money can be either a slave for us or it can make us slaves. Many people rate the quality of life and sucess by a dollar figure that they made last year. Others rate success one heir more substantive accomplishments that agree with their sense of values, of which money is not number one.

In our changing economy any individual who holds down a job must be concerned with rather or not he or she will continue to have that job. Many people are being laid off work or let go because the companies are no longer making enough profit to pay the employees. A criminal will always be employed. There is never a lack of work are a means for continuing employment.\n\nThen if we think about the work day of most working people. The average worker works 8 hours per day. They make about $7.50 per hour for their labor. This is $300.00 per week before taxes and other deductions. Tax deductions will run about $69.00 per week and deductions for medical\/dental insurance will costs them another $5.00 per week bringing their actual take home pay to $266.00 per week. The average criminal can work one hour a day and make $300.00 without having to be concerned with deductions for medical insurance and taxes. Further the criminal does not have to be at work at a specific time for a specific numbers of hours each day. The criminal is his\/her own boss.\n\nAnd finally, the one thing the criminal does have in common with the average worker; retirement.

If a criminal starts at age 15 and works only 5 hours per week until age 30 he or she could be set for life. At $300.00 per hour over 15 years the criminal earns $1,170,000.00.

The target group was children who had become economically dependent because of the deaths of their fathers. The theory behind the act was that the number of families headed by women, who were primarily widows at that time, would remain small and that these mothers should remain at home rather than trying to achieve economic independence in the labor market.\n      However, by 1962, welfare rolls had expanded.

In addition, it is also very dangerous to place all of one's trust in a  machine. It is a common fact machines do fail! Sure, a car with a computer that tells the driver when an on-coming obstical is approaching is safe, but what happens when the driver relies too much on the computer and not enough on their own brain? People soon stop thinking, and allow machines to do the work for them. I feel afraid when our society relies so heavily on a bunch of wires. Computers are not able to express and truly feel emotions, and therefore are incapable, in some instances to function. With the invention of the computer comes many changes from the lifestyle of the past to changes in the lifestyle for the future. Some of these changes will save people's lives, such as advances in medical technology, safety, etc.","num_words":395}

I think that the most significant discovery or invention will depend on the individual.  Every individual holds a different perspective of life and what they consider to be valuable and important. I chose cultural awareness and understanding prejudice & discrimination as my topic, because I greatly value all of humanity and I believe that all people should learn to live in peace.\n\tCultural and racial equality is a new term that as a society we are striving for.  People have come to realize that racism is almost inherent in today's society.  As individuals we are constantly surrounded by racist and discriminitive media language and advertising. In the past this type of discrimination, which includes more then blacks African Americans, but also other ethnicities and women, has been excepted as a way of life. Few individuals have been courageous enought to challenge the deeply breed sterotypes, and inequality, and demand freedom and equality.  Numerous hidden talents, strong wise personal voices and the great knowledge and learning that results from human experience and suffering has been burried under the ignorance of our society.  However, today we are beginning to move in a new direction.  People are understanding that prejudice and discrimination are not consciously learned but they must be unlearned. Together as a society, and as a much larger world we are recognizing the value in learning from difference. Cultural differences are no longer being ignored or concealed but rather they are being celebrated. Organizations and forms are presently being held to discover new ways of dealing with discrimination and racism.\n\tThe opportunity to learn about the vast world around us is opening up, the avalibility to study cultural difference and reflect the knowledge on ourselves is improving. Unlearning prejudice may not seem like a traditional discovery but it is very significant to the development and peaceful existance of all humanity.

Although his theory [his and his wife's] was basically scientific in nature, it can and has been applied to all areas of human existence. The theory I'm speaking of is relativity. With this theory also came the area of quantum mechanics. It is difficult to condense this topic, a topic which has volumes, volumes a literature.\n\tPersonally, I find that relativity hasn't had its full impact. This is probably for several reasons: First, the notion that every point is a point of departure and that all other points are in reference to that point of departure is rather abstract. It seems impossible and it leaves humans grasping for closure. What Einstien did to humanity's philosophy was change the notion that closure could be obtained. The socratic idea that all was known. And that it was only a matter of time before a \"moment\" would reveal the knowledge from \"within\" was in effect shattered. The philosopher's stone was pulverized into utopic and nostolgic dust.\n\tSince it is my socialization that leads me to have a notion of earthtime [24 hours = day] I think Einstien reconstructed part of it. Although I don't claim to understand relativity, I've attempted to indwell the topic [like sidphantha and his rock]. The point is my notion of time has changed; And I think once humanity realizes that time-notions are human constructions and are subject to change, that then the impact of Einstien's idea will be felt. For now we are left with a world that has used Einstien's \"invention\" for intentions not worthy of the genius; namely: atomic bombs.\n\tThe significance of atomic bombs cannot be underestimated when speaking about humanity in the 20th century. It set-up a whole network of global systems. USA-USSR; with Japan and Germany as the \"winners\". Cold wars; north-south relations. Many things have been generated: namely fear! Relatively speaking, fear has been the main point of departure for the global community construction. This is a point that I think needs to be changed, from fear to peace. A shift in focus if you will. Some would say this is too utopic;\n But if humanity sought to understand relativity (as does Stephen Hawkings) our notions would be radically changed.","num_words":388}

While many people enjoy and utilize the shopping malls, I believe that they are more of a detriment than a blessing.\n\tKalamazoo, like most American cities, began surrounding the central means of transportation. Cities were first located near water, then near train tracks,  and then began to locate themselves farther away due to the inventions of trucks and cars. Downtown Kalamazoo was once a thriving and successful district. Near the train station were the larger industries, and other essential specialized stores for everyday supplies. Homes and neighborhoods were located outside of the central city;  however, many stores had several floors of apartments above them to accommodate families to live in.\nEveryone was near the central city -  so everyone could use the central city.\nRich and poor alike had easy access to the offerings of the central city. Throughout history, the trend is for the rich to get richer and the poor remain poor. While the rich got richer, they began building specialized shops and strip malls outside of the city limits. And, the more wealthy moved from the inner city (with help from the invention of the automobile) to the suburbs where the could keep a distance from the busy inner city. While the more wealthy began moving away from the inner city, the poor and lower working class remained due to lack of transportation or money to move outwards. This process has left the businesses in the inner cities, including Kalamazoo, without a stable clientel. Why should we, say those with cars, go downtown where the more poorer people are and have to shop outside going from specialized store to store, when I can go to a nice indoor mall that has everything? Businesses that could move out of the downtown district did, and still do, and relocate in strip malls near the main malls or in the malls themselves. I believe it is only the storeowners who realize this process is occurring or enjoy the downtown district remain and stay in business. Many larger factories and office building still remain downtown.

Clearly, of the inventions of this century, the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television. This instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room, making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible. However, the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time;  one has only to turn it on to tune out reality.\n\tTelevision has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers, such as educational programming for children, cultural programs about far away places, and a closer look at current events than cannot be given by newspaper. Television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production, giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully. However, this is not the way in which television has influenced society. On the contrary, television has become the escape route of the masses, a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture, rather than confront them and try to understand them. \n\tIn the minds of most Americans, television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool, as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge. Millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time, watching sit-coms, soap-operas, and cartoons. The T.V. has become the center of many households; in many families, the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television. T.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families,  and has also resulted in an increase in laziness. The more time one spends watching TV, the less motivated he becomes; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch, pick up the remote control, and stare at a box.\n\tTelevision, therefore, has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago.

Unfortunately this still occurs, but with increasing medical & technological advances starting at the middle of the century many people have been rescued from the torment of disease.  Perhaps the greatest invention and discovery is the polio vaccine, invented by Salk, which changed the future, and future's children. The effects of such a vaccine are countless and inequivalent to any other invention of the 20th century. Why was it so great?  It changed the population  and acted as a foundation for further medical advances.\n\t For 20 year olds polio has never never been an issue, it is one of the many vaccines we received as a child and for us the new dreaded ailment is AIDS, which we have no cure for - for some of our parents, and grandparents this was what they feared. The vaccine was utilized for the first time in the middle of the century for our parents and the decade after that - The Baby Boom.  With this new vaccination less children were dying, or being mamed, and had a greater chance of having a healthy childhood.  For sure there was an effect on the population as a whole and whether it had anything to do with the Baby Boom is for each individual to decide. The vaccination did not CAUSE the \"boom\"  but  since there is a larger surviving group born during than time, the contribution could have been one of life span. I'm sure in the past there were \"booms\" especially after wartime, but the population of children at that time would gradually level off due to disease.  Usually disease plays a role of population control.  Every few years a new one comes along to normalize an overpopulated world.  The polio vaccine stopped death in its path. \n\tThe process of vaccination also opened new doors. Things weren't impossible any more,  and no matter how strange it seemed; injecting the dead virus to protect you from the virus itself would prevent the onset of the disease.

The invention of the airplane has also affected areas other than solely (vacation) travel, business, entertainment, & intercontinental relations (politics) have also felt the impact of the airplane.\n\t As I've already said the area of travel has been greatly improved due to the airplane. Travel times have been significantly shorten;  for example, to drive from Michigan to California takes about 30-35 hours, but to fly the same distance takes about 3 hours. This allows people a greater variety of places to travel, and they can spend their vacation time at their choosen destination, not trying to get there.\n\tThe business world has definitely flourished due to the airplane. As a result of the greatly decreased travel times, countries can work together much easier than previously possibly. Also, business relations within a country have improved. Today, it is relatively easy for an American businessperson to have business relations in any part of the world. I have seen this in the increase in International Business during the past few decades.\n\tEntertainment, a very large field, has grown with the invention of the airplane. Now, entertainers, whether they be musicans, actors, or athletes, can travel from place to place much more quickly. For example, Michael Jackson just gave a concert in Madrid, this was made much easier because of the airplane. Professional athletic teams reduce travel time, and are able to play more games in many different places because travel is so easy.\n\tThe last area I'm going to touch on is intercontinental relations. This area has been positively and negatively effected. Positive aspects are those such as \"Peace Talks\" between nations; these would not take place as often as the do, if it took the President 1 week to get to where they were going. Also heads of state can more easily interact with each other (in their perspective countries) with the use of air transportation. There are negative aspects, too.

Since there was little tolerance of homosexuality in the early 80's, no one really cared that gays would die.  Then it became known that IV drug users could also contract AIDS.  And once again no one really cared, simply because they thought AIDS would never effect them.  How wrong they were.\n Once children became infected with AIDS, society began to care.  It was inconceivable that a small child could die from such a horrific disease.  As the 80's came to a close there was a greater awareness of AIDS;  however, with the awareness also came discrimination.\n\tRyan White, a twelve year old hemophiliac, was the first person to have his disease widely publicized.

Parents are still fighting the distribution of condoms in schools  and they want their children to learn abstinence and not sex education.  Abstinence is the only safe way to prevent AIDS, but society must be realistic.  Children are becoming sexually active at the age of eleven.  How likely is it that an eleven year old is going to go to a pharmacy & buy condoms?  Most people are more careful about who they sleep with, and AIDS has become less of a taboo subject & more of an accepted reality.\n\tDue to the discovery of AIDS people are aware that if they are promiscuous & do not practice safe sex, they could die.  Society has become aware of its mortality, and in some cases, has banded together to try to find a cure for AIDS.

I often dwell on the characteristics of mankind that lead us to continually invent new things.  We seem to be somewhat obsessed with technology, and using it to dominate nature, as well as our fellow man.  Technology and inventions seem to stem from our natural fear of death and our human insecurities.  We attempt to  dominate nature so that we may live without fearing death, and we attempt to dominate other people so that we may live without our petty insecurities.  For these reasons , I would argue that the only inventions of the twentieth century that have significantly changed people's lives for the better are those that have occured in the medical field.  Although these inventions do stem from a fear of death, they do not attempt to dominate nature nor other human beings as the majority of other inventions do.  They save lives.\n\tBy closely analyzing the nature of modern inventions, one notes a consistent trend leading away from a lifestyle that is peacefully coexistent with nature.   We are ourselves a part of nature, yet we attempt to live outside of it.  We continue to destroy the plants, animals, and the earth itself  and our new inventions help us to do it in more efficient ways.  Therefore, inventions in the 0the century have had, for the most part, a negative affect on our lives because by destroying nature, we're destroying ourselves.\n\tIn addition, our inventions are used to dominate one another.  We invent better weapons and better economic systems geared for killing and depriving other people.\n\tMedical inventions, on the other hand, are designed to help people of all colors, and cannot be used to dominate nature or other people. They are one of the only truely \"kind\" expressions of mankind's creativity.\n","num_words":306}

Not certain about the date of its invention, it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today, amongst world leaders, trading companies, and the media, as well as the entertainment world.\n\tTed Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite, with his creation of CNN, the round-the-clock, round-the-world news station.

The creation of MTV in 1980, has dramatically changed the entertainment business.  The money poured into creating videos, and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on the world economy.  40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers.\n\tThe Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well.  The intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing, created by the satellite dish.  Naval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States, due to the satellite dish.  And one must not forget space programs such a STARWARS.\n\tThe creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years, has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse. It has created an information age, which could be dangerous, and heightened an entertainer's salary.  The pro's and con's of the satellite dish are numerous. The only observation which can be made, is that: It has altered people lives significantly.  It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse.\n","num_words":391}

During the 1950's, America witnessed the beginnings of a cultural revolution. The era of Populuxe instigated a `must-have' ideology in the nation and the most important `must-have' was, of course, the television. The  presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture: the mass culturization of various grupes, the commercialization of our lifestyles, and the rapidity and breath of the information that reaches us.\n\tGathered around the tube, the American family learned the `ideal' way of life. But the picture of perfection was the same in every home. We all received the same information. We all saw the same families, The Cleavers & The Andersons, etc. telling how we should behave. Mother was always beautiful, father knew best,  & children had cute, silly, harmless problems. As a result of this omniscient picture, a farmer in Iowa had an idea of what a family in New York consisted of. People in N.Y. watched Green Acres. Today the same trend continues. To white people, Ghetto life is slightly less of a mystery. The examples on television are blown-up &exaggerated, but people get a general idea of different lifestyles. Rather than several small, isolated cultures, the united States is moving towards a mass culturalization\n and the presence of another's reality in our homes is a major part of the reason.\n\tAnother effect of the television on people's lives is the commercialization of our lives. Advertisements, which originally served only to inform people of their purchasing options, have developed into an art form. 15 second blocks of our time are sold for millions of dollars and as a result the American population is made to laugh, or to cry, & often times to buy a product.\n\tFinally, & perhaps most importantly, the citizens of America have experienced w\/ the advent of the television a great increase in the amount of information they receive, as well as in the time it takes to reach them. A hundred years ago, different sections of the country (and world) were isolated & separated by the time it takes to mail a letter & print a newspaper story.\n Today, we know within seconds, or in the case of the space-shuttle challenger explosion, we know live-immediately.","num_words":388}

Perhaps one does stand out a little more among its competition, however; that is the television.\n\tBefore the late 1940's entertainment, news, and information vertually all came through newspapers & radio. A system that seemed to work, many households throughout the nation owned or had access to a radio and or newspaper where they could get the day's information easily and completely. And, in the case of the radio, all was almost immediate. Description of sporting events, voices acting out stories, persons of the government speaking directly to the people, the radio seemed the perfect solution to countries with its citizens living at all ends of its boarders.\n\tThe advent of the television changed all of that, however, giving the public a \"peak\" at what radio wasn't able to give them. Along with the news and information the radio brought to the homes of the people of the world, the television was able to add images- pictures that enhanced the entire absorbtion of what was being broadcast. Where once a reporter's voice described a scene, now the people could see for themselves what was happening because, for the most part, it was happening in front of their eyes.\n\tBesides the obvious higher level of enjoyment television watching may bring its viewer, the most important aspect of this creation is its ability to bring the worlds together.

The computer however in this, the information age, has had a great impact on how society and especially business gathers, creates, responds to and, understands everyday information.\n\tThe computer has been around since the end of the Second World War. It was mainly used though, by corporations and government to process the huge amounts of information that they needed to gather. At that time the ordinary everyday person had no need to process information as we do today. As the world got more complex and people started to process and receive information that was much more sophisticated, they needed a tool in order to help them with it. No longer was a secretary and a typewriter enough to handle the ever increasing needs that technology and business put upon society.\n\tIn 1980 IBM Corporation started a revolution that today continues full force to dominate our everyday lives;  the invention of the personal computer. What the PC (personal computer) meant for society was an affordable tool that would help one sort out, save, delete or add and receive information in one's own home. This made it possible to write papers, look over databases, do your taxes and expense accounts, just about anything that you had to do. It was a way to organize your work and the information that you had to process in an easier fashion and much more quickly. Since 1980 there have been many advances in the technology that was first made available because of this machine. They got faster, more sophisticated, more programs were made available, and they soon became more compatible with other technologies. What this meant was that you now had a faster tool that could do more, receive more, and analyze more information than ever before. Today you can sit in your home at the terminal and create just about any form of document that you wish. You can use it to do just about any task you need it for.

Through the television, news and information can be graphically displayed at the very same time that it is happening.  This simple fact has changed in many ways how we live, and in a way it has, and continues to shrink the planet we live on.

One could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease, hunger, and threatening weather;  also as noted above, it was extremely time consuming.  Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world.

TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas, images, news, etc.   Now, if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening.  While previously people had to wait days, or even weeks for news (which consisted of second-or third-hand accounts, which always involved much interpretation & distortion) now they can see it happening, for themselves, as it is happening, this allows them to make their own, informed judgment about the event; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately, while the emotions are still strong, and before the action is finalized.  As well, the fact that so many people (especially in the US) have television sets means that everybody (well, at least everybody who watches) receives the same inflow of information & ideas.  So, for example, people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak & act, this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas.\n\t In my opinion, this is one part of the process of making the world a \"smaller\", more unified place, or a \"global village\" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age.\n\tNot only the news, but also entertainment is an important practical function of television, through television entertainment, as through literature & drama, people learn different messages about life.  They can see various actions acted out to their ends, and understand the consequences of these actions, without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves.  Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence, as well as making life seem the good guy always wins, and always lives thru dangerous situations.

With this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen. This wave is the microwave.\n\tNever before has such an invention revolutionized a science like this.\n A complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared. At the dawn of time, cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires. As History progressed, spits and barbeques emerged. Technology saw the advent of the wood stove, and later ones fueled by coal. Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to staple. All these things had one thing in common: FIRE. Flame, the source of life, always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History. However, the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food, thus creating friction, which creates heat. This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes.\n\tIf this were not amazing enough, the microwave cuts cooking time in half. If you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half, and not use fire, they would have thought you crazy, or bewitched, or under the influence of heavy drugs. In an age where time is the scarcest comodity, our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen. A mother who works, can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave, whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen. The microwave is excellent for re-heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later. Again time is conserved --  Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting. For As I have said before, there is no fire! This marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century.\n\tThroughout History one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition, new insights, and differents perspectives.

They can take their cellular phones on vacations & to their friends houses if they are expecting an important call.  To me, it is a bit ridiculous, but lots of people feel like they need this easy access to a phone.\n\tAnother way the cellular telephone has affected people's lives is the accident rate of people who are talking on their car phone.  When someone is concentrating more on their telephone conversation and less on their driving, they are more likely to get into an accident.  This happens often when people are in heavy traffic and are not concentrating on the car in front of them.  So, cellular phones also have a negative aspect to them.

These coaches allow their teams to score points well into the seventies and make the weaker teams look bad. A prime example of this is the Florida, Carolina game. Carolina was getting their butts beat bad and with just fourteen seconds left on the clock before halftime, coach Steve Spurrier called a timeout so that Florida could score again. Carolina was already losing by four touchdowns. Florida did score with two seconds left. He wasn't done yet because in the fourth quarter Florida was faced with a fourth down and two situation twice and Steve went for it both times each time getting the first down. They eventually scored. The final score was Florida 63 and the Gamecocks 7. I know I made Steve Spurrier sound like a jerk, but who could blame him. Florida held the number two ranking at the beginning of the season, but was eventually knocked down to number three because Florida State was beating their opponents worse than Florida. Florida State was probably the better team, but Florida State lost a game along with it's ranking giving Florida a chance to regain the number two ranking. The following week Florida was playing a really weak team, so coach Steve Spurrier was a nice guy and started his second string quarterback so the game wouldn't be so embarrassing. Florida won by an impressive margin, thinking they would regain the number two spot, but much to their surprise, Ohio State, the number four team, slipped into the number two spot because they beat their opponent worse than Florida.

Over the years, the question of whether American culture should maintain distinct genre identities has risen. I have come to the conclusion that for psychological, sociological and economic reasons, the culture should maintain gender identitites, but only to a certain extent.\n\tThe stereotyped male image would have a man as being strong, courageous, self-reliant, and the backbone of the family. On the other hand, a woman would be femine. Meaning gentle, emotional, sensitive, loving, and her future plans revolving around her husband and children. These so called images although maybe pleasant to some people, are not always realistic. For instance a man is not always the strong backbone of the family, the culture makes him out to be. The successful business woman\/single mother may however be the backbone of the family, providing both emotional and financial support.\n\tHaving the typical image is advantageous in creating role models for growing boys, so they learn to be strong, and know how to provide both moral and financial support for their famimlies. But this unfortunately puts alot of pressure on men, as they aspire to get through college, get the best jobs with good salaries, they may then become so preoccupied with their job and success, that they neglect their families and become enstranged from them. This is clearly the case in Warren Farrell's book \"Why men are the way they 'are'\", in which Ralph admits that he worked so hard to provide for his family, that he lost touch with them.\nThe other disadvantage of having an ideal male image reflects the issue of sensitivity in men. According to William Masters a social scientist, school age boys are generally expected to show mascularity by demonstrating physical competence and bravery, and are criticized for showing fear or emotions afterall, big boys don't cry.

Even the best parents allow their children to watch Saturday morning cartoons where, as Pollit cites, the most egregious errors occur.  Parents allow their kids to watch these cartoons for two reasons; first, because they watched them when they were kids and second, because parents are not interested in justice, they just want quiet.

Yet, \"The Problem That Has No Name,\" (an excerpt from \"The Feminine Mystique\") described women who fretted about their lives and wished for something more, but they were not sure what. Feminists, following Friedan's logic, extolled the glamour, self-enhancement, and personal satisfaction of pursuing a career. Many women followed this advice and at the same time did their best to have a successful marriage and be a perfect mother. In the process, society witnessed the evolution of the career woman who worked from 9 to 5 each day, then raced home after picking up the kids from nursery school or a babysitter, prepared supper, listened to homework of older children, put them to bed, and then tackled some housework.

Society and media shouldn't persuade us as to what true beauty is.  From the beginning of adolecense, girls are faced with implications from the news, television, and magazines to have the perfect body, skin, and hair.  Because of the standards that society place on women, teenagers, and young girls, there are many disorders which alter these females' state of mind, health, and body.  Disorders so severe that there is such a strong dissatisfaction with one's appearance that they interfere with living healthy.\nOf course this problem is not the model's fault, they are doing there job of being beautiful.

The legalization of some drugs like marijuana would improve many different aspects of society.\nHealth problems seem to be a concern as far as legalization goes.  Issues such as permanent damage to the brain and other parts of the anatomy.  The fact is that people are going to use drugs anyway, so why not regulate the pureness of some of these drugs.

The side effects of marijuana is not apparent as some other drugs.  I do not feel as strongly about legalizing crack cocaine as others.  There are some other things legal today, which can have potentially deadly results.  Lung cancer from cigarette smoke, liver failure from the abuse of alcohol, and the potential loss of teeth and gum damage from chewing tobacco.\n\tIf marijuana among other drugs were legalized, should there be an age limitation? If children obeyed the law, it would be a good idea.  However, they do not.  An age limit would probably just encourage kids to see if they could\nstill get drugs.

While men and women are naturally different, the laws of the land must treat everyone equally. With fairness alone in mind there has been a resent social mood to permanently disintegrate the sacred differences between males and females. Men and women can enjoy there differences, especially physical differences, while remaining fair to themselves as well as remaining fair to the opposite sex.\n\tRecently there has been a trend to facilitate an equal playing field for both female and male athletes. By law we should equally fund all sexes sports, but in reality some sports bring in more revenue than others. The classic example is the relatively male sport of football in relation to women's volleyball. At my high school I had people argue about the disproportionally funded sports. They would not necessarily argue that volleyball should get funded equally with football, but that if the football team has the second best facilities in the state then the volleyball team should have the second best facilities. In actuality the football team started out with the worst facilities in the state, but through hard work and years of dedication the football team built up faithful. These faithful have spent there money to boost the football tearn and in doing so boost the football facilities.\nA problem arose when it came time for a new football facility and a new volleyball facility to be constructed, but there were only funds for one or the other. In the end the money got split between the two. This example could be looked at as communism. All the money was split evenly to benefit all.

Second, the teams should spend the money on the facilities for the fans. Third, a salary cap would put a halt on the players determining how much money they are going to make the following year.\nIs the college graduate the honored person these days? For many reasons the answer is no. A student can graduate from college as a doctor of science and still not be as important, nor make as much money as a professional football player. Yes, usually the football player is known all over the world, but what is the real significance of his job? A doctor, or a nurse work for more than forty hours a week saving other peoples lives and still don't get as much recognition as a pro football player does. A football player can start his first year and get more glory and honor than is needed for someone that does nothing but entertain. In many ways this is wrong. We need doctors, but do wee really need professional football players? The American people need to think about what is more important to live. We could live without sports but we will always need doctors. Which job would be considered the most important to the American person? With the money that the professional football players make it would seem that they are more important than doctors. A professional football player makes more money in one year than a doctor does in a lifetime. Is this really fair? In many ways it is not fair. Mainly because doctors have to work very hard to get where they are going and football players don't do anything that is considered rewarding. All you have to be able to do is run and catch balls that are thrown to you. A person could not be smart enough to pass the second grade, but as long as he can play ball he is going to be rich.

In these two shows, if everyone isn't sleeping with everyone else, then the characters are not happy. On Beverly Hills, 90210, everyone on that show has or will have slept with everyone else, by the end of the season. Television isn't the only place where sex is everywhere.\nWe also have radio.

Then again some songs don't even have to be listened to, to realize they are talking about sex. \"Sex Me\", by R.

Instead, they show a model lying down with a sheet wrapped around her body. Nothing but a sheet. Now if I'm not mistaken, shampoo is used to wash your hair not your whole body, so why show her half dressed body. \"Gravity\", a cologne for men, has ads with a man kissing on a woman, both half dressed, soak and wet on a beach.

When the pain becomes unbearable and the medication stops working some people would rather die than to continue to live in pain. Those patient's who desire to end their lives do not wish to do so on their own. They prefer to have an easy and painless death, and so they choose a form of suicide which is referred to as euthanasia. Euthanasia is a \"mercy killing\" for the purpose of putting an end to extreme suffering. Many of the cases concerning euthanasia in the past few years have been performed or assisted by a doctor known as Dr. Kevorkian. There has been much controversy over assisted suicides, especially those performed with the assistance of a doctor. Should it be legalized to allow doctors to assist in suicides of terminally ill patients, or should they be bound by their Hippocratic Oath?\nThere are several different forms of euthanasia. One form of euthanasia is when a person's life is in a permanently unconscious state, sometimes referred to as a \"vegetable.\" When a person is in this state, if they do not have a living will stating their wishes, the family has the right to make the decision concerning whether the patient should remain on life support or not after they have consulted with the physician concerning the matter. There are very few legal objections to this form of euthanasia. It is widely practiced in hospitals all over America. Many people leave in their will expressed wishes to not be kept alive on life support systems. When the physician determines that there is no chance of a patient's\nrecovery, it is their duty to carry out the patient's wishes and disconnect life support. Another type of euthanasia is when a patient requests that the doctor provide no more treatment. If medical conduct to end the patient's life is prohibited, the patient is allowed maximum opportunity to change his mind and demand treatment. The patient declining treatment normally remains alive for a period and thereby receives some opportunity to change one's mind or to eliminate any mistake on the physicians part in comprehending the patient's wishes.

But the poll writers couldn't overlook the fact that Florida State had one loss while Alabama was still undefeated.","num_words":370}

Too many students fight alcoholism in high school and college environment. This problem could easily be curtailed by lowering the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen. Changing the drinking age from twenty-one to eighteen would lower the amount of crimes among young adults, encourage a more responsible approach to alcohol in the United States and improve the health of the nation. Allowing alcohol consumption at age eighteen would change the way America viewed alcohol-use as a society. Lowering the drinking age would gradually change society, and encourage a more mature management of alcohol.\nLowering the drinking age would decrease the amount of crime among youths. Many youths break the law every time they attempt to buy or consume alcohol. Lowering the drinking age would allow youths to buy alcohol and not break the law doing it. on most college campuses, alcohol is involved in most violent behavior or crimes (Rick Finley@rfinleygmail.vt.edu). Lowering the drinking age would allow college campuses to spend more time reviewing education instead of drinking policies. Today, many colleges are experiencing major problems with underage drinking. Many colleges are struggling with enforcing these policies (WWW.mis.duke.edu\/Task-forces\/Alcohol\/Alcohol-chart.html).\nLowering the drinking age would allow colleges to spend more time reforming education programs and aiding students. A high amount of underage drinking occurs in the high school and college environments (US Department of Health and Human Services). Allowing alcohol consumption at age eighteen would cut back on reform programs because less people would need these programs. Most candidates for reform programs are under the national drinking age (US Department of Justice 3-62). Eighteen- year old Is would not feel a need to strike back at society for \"lost rights.\" Adolescents are in an awkward place in society, being between childhood and adulthood (Newman 506). Allowing eighteen-year olds to drink would include eighteen-year olds in society and make them less likely to cause crimes as a way of expressing their anger. Many young adults that drink, drink uncontrollably and in large environments (Newman 506). Giving youths back their privileges of drinking will allow them to fit in and feel included in society.\nLowering the drinking age would encourage a responsible approach to alcohol in the United States. Giving back drinking rights to eighteen-year old's would make them realize their privileges.","num_words":392}

Democrats in the White House seem to think that more education and training for jobs within a two year time limit is the key.  Republicans in Congress, on the other hand, seem to think perhaps shorter time limits and cuts in spending on some welfare programs would be the answer (Silverstein 13-15).  However, the heatedly argued welfare issue can be solved by combining the ideas of both parties.  The welfare program would be successful if it changed to include a time limit, training programs that are required, less government funding for certain welfare programs, and abolishing the law that states that women should get more money for having more children.\nBoth parties agree on having time limits and training programs so that welfare recipients can find jobs (Economist 33).  It is important for recipients to work for their welfare check so that they do not become dependent on the system.  After all, the\npurpose of welfare should be to help recipients in a tough time, not support them for the rest of their life (Sliverstein 13).\nTraining programs should be an essential part of the welfare program.  \"fourteen million people survive off welfare payments,' (Silverstein 14) and by making recipients participate \"in well-designed welfare-to-work programs or training programs can reduce, long-term welfare dependency\" (Economist 33).  These training programs would help most women who have been on welfare for years.  \"These women have so little work experience that they have to rehearse with social workers to remember to say ,good-bye, and thank you, at the end of an interview\" (Whitman\n30).\nIn Chicago, a highly regarded training program, Project match, has given a mix of education, training, counseling, and job-placement to its clients and has gotten half of them off of welfare. (Economist 33)\nAnother success story of these programs is that of Princess Rowell.  She has been on welfare for nine years and lost half of her 517 dollar welfare payment for refusing to look for a job.  She then entered a highschool equivalency diploma program and does her homework every night (whitman 36-37).  She is still receiving payments but is also receiving an education that may help her to someday get out of the welfare program.","num_words":395}

Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent. Violence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime, psychotic murderers, police cases, emergency services, international terrorism, and war (Hepburn 1). Television violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children.\nThe V-chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows. Some people, such as the Senate Commerce Committee, are not satisfied with it. The Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so-called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it. The bills would apply to broadcasting and cable (Stern 1).\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows: the Senate V-chip, the House V-chip, a Technology Fund, a Violence Safe Harbor, and a Violence Report Card. These proposals could work if Congress had some support. The National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \"piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy\". The NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television (Stern 1).\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers. If a certain plot involves a murder, then the murder must happen. Some people may not want the actual murder to be shown, but that is up to whomever is writing the television show. Many made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised, but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager?\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks' programming during the 1995-1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence' pervades a significant number of Saturday-morning cartoons (Jensen 1).

Recycling would include not just the standard aluminum cans and paper bags but also plastic, steel, glass, refrigerators, batteries, and so on. In order for this world to be one that our children and grandchildren can benefit from, recycling needs to become commonplace uniformly.  Before every landfill and dump site is exhausted, the human population needs to educate themselves on the few, simple steps that can be taken to maximize the room that is left in landfills for recyclable materials.\n\"Most plastic can be recycled and collection for plastics is increasing rapidly' (Recycler's Bill of Rights 1).  This includes but is not limited to; plastic bags, containers, cups, toys and hangars.  All plastic products have recycling codes on them somewhere, on the bottom.  The codes have different meanings because if plastics are mixed, it can ruin the melt (Recycler's 1).  Most types of plastic grocery bags can be mixed together.  Even some bags that contain bread, pasta, and marshmallows can be recycled together.  Many plastic products such as compact discs, video tapes, and computer discs are made from mixed materials which can't be recycled unless first disassembled (Recycler's 1).  Corporations that produce grocery bags are starting to realize the importance of being environmentally friendly.  The Superbag Corporation produces their bags with a significant amount of recycled material.  The finished product is completely recyclable and this material can be used in a number of ways (Superbag 1).  Plastic bags are much better for the environment than paper bags because their production is better for the natural\nresources.\nThe brown paper bags used in some supermarkets are made from virgin paper, without contributions from recycled materials.  Paper making pollutes the water, releases dioxin, contributes to acid rain and costs trees ... Heretical as it may sound, some uses of virgin paper can be more damaging to wildlife than plastic substitutes . . . If they (consumers) support virgin paper bags over plastic bags, they are implicitly supporting higher levels of pollution (Superbag 1).","num_words":367}

Obviously, some areas, such as defense cuts, seem appropriate since the United States no longer is faced with the imminent threat of attack from another super-power. Yet, there are some areas, such as government support for the arts, which should keep, if not receive more, support from government agencies.\nWhy should the arts, both the visual and performing arts, be supported by the government? Perhaps the most general reason rests in the views of anthropology: since the beginning of human civilization, man has seen a need for interpreting and depicting his world. In this depiction, he chose to communicate in a way that would last through the ages. Thanks to the ingenuity and interpretation of primitive cultures, we still have today cave and wall drawings that communicate to us the very essence of early human thought. This is a classic model of how we of today can leave an impression for future generations. These generations will be able to look in retrospect and see what we thought was important.\nSimilarly, art also helps us to communicate with each other and show others our values. Using two leaders of France, it's interesting to note how Louis XIV- XVI and Napoleon desired to use the decorative arts to impress the globe with the glory of France. Certainly, these leaders hoped to communicate the opulence and prestige of their reigns.\nHowever, art also helps us communicate with each other in day-to-day living. Children's drawings are a good example of this. In these, verbal skills are minimized and focused mainly on the communication of the basic idea. These are very basic, but it is interpretable by nearly everyone in a precise, pictorial form.\nFollowing from the idea of sharing, the performing and visual arts link communities together. In a simplistic manner, it is often like team sports. People who, for instance, are in a ballet troupe together bond as they work together to produce something of quality and pride. Camaraderie, and oftentiines friendship, emerges among fellow performers. For patrons of the arts, as they appreciate the arts with others, they, too, may develop friendships and bonds developed over a common interest.","num_words":387}

There are two categories that people place themselves in. The two names for this categories are either pro-choiceor pro-life. Regardless of which category they claim, its hard to determine who really obtains enough knowledge to judge the morality of the issue. So, the decision to have an abortion or not should be left entirely up to the woman who is dealing with this situation. According to the situation, she is the only one who knows what consequences will be taken on and how much the child will suffer.\nThe pro-choicers, as well as proffers, have argued various points to make their points either for or against abortion.\nAlthough if you analyze many of these arguments they are not very substantial. For example some anti-abortionist, think that even woman women who have abortions. Rape is something that the woman has no control over and they should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted baby. The anti-abortionist's neglect of these topics shows there tendencies to ignore special cases of woman who are unwillingly impregnated. Views like this by prolifers make their whole argument seem very unrealistic about the whole issue of abortion and why it might be necessary.\nAnother common argument used by anti-abortionists is one known as the Slippery Nazi Slope. According to this argument, abortion is a form of genocide. They say that a society that accepts abortion is the same as what the Nazis did when they killed the Jews. This may sound like a strong argument, but it also is not substantial if you look at the true meaning of ,-genocide.

Instead they are placed on death row, which on the average lasts a little over eighteen years.  During these eighteen years the convicted criminal goes up for continuous appeals.  These appeals are extremely expensive due to excessive court costs.  When offered these facts some try to suggest that we eliminate the appeal system.  This approach is impractical because the appeal system is a major part in the backbone of our judicial system.  So if the cost of punishment is at all a concern for you, then it is obvious that capital punishment is the wrong\ndirection to go.","num_words":370}

I told them at that time that they had lost the quality of their news, and the price was just too high for what they had in their paper.\nOver the passing years, I have come to know a \"new media.\" It is no longer the media of my younger years. Then, newspapers, radio and television were successfiil without dragging up all kinds of dirt on any and every person or event that came along.\nI guess my realization of this \"right to know\" came when United States troops were sent into Grenada in the 1980's. The media's \"right to know' was unknowingly broadcasting troop movements to the enemy, endangering the fives of our young people. As a parent of one of these young people, I was appalled and infuriated. How dare they endanger lives with their \"right to know\". It happened again in Desert Storm and Bosnia. What happened to waiting for the battle to end before the cameras and lights went on? I suppose this might come under the people's 'right to know\", however, I am sure they would hope that the sons and daughters they sent to fight, would at least have a small chance of surviving the first impact before someone told the enemy where they were. Watch out, future warriors of this country. It may be your turn to step up in front of a camera when you least expect it. \nIn the early 1990's, the United States was looking for a new Surgeon General to replace Jocelyn Elders. The media took a perfectly good candidate, who probably would have made an excellent Surgeon General, and dug up as much dirt on him as possible. They found he had performed four abortions and despite the other good things this person may have done in his life, he was rejected on this reason.","num_words":381}

That questions is should women be allowed to attend the Citadel. There has been many objections to this statement, but there are alao many firm believers behind it.\nWhenever asked why shouldn't women be admitted there are two things that always come out first. They are that it has traditionally been an all male institution and women couldn't handle it. Yes, it has been tradition to only enroll males, but as the saying goes traditions are meant to be broken. If traditions weren't broken you would still have black slaves, women would all be housewives and so on. If society changes its way of living then it must change its traditions also. As time goes on certain things fade away and other things become more important to us. Most traditions are broken to benefit society or to create it more equal. People would like to say or believe that we live in an equal society, but as a women I especially know that is not true. Society has changed a lot for the better, but not everything is completely equal. Men are just like women, some of them may be strong or intelligent but others may not be. A woman could do a job just as well as a man or just as bad. This brings us to the point that women could not handle the duties of attending the Citadel. I will not say all women could because I know they couldn't, but not all men could either. Some people say that women do not have enough physical strength. That may be true in some cases, but others might be able to handle the challenges, Everyone does deserve the chance to try.\nIn our country if a school is publically funded it can't desciniinate against race, religion, gender or handicapped people. The Citadel is pubfically funded, therefore what makes it any different. Why should they not have to follow the same rules as other schools? If all public schools started to say you can only come here if you are hispanic or if you are poliish our schooling system would be in great chaos. People would have to travel far away to attend the school that fit them. This would be a lot of extra people needed to teach, drive buses, clean and cook.","num_words":400}

It seems that nowadays the use of Marijuana is extremely widespread, even the president admits to smoking it. Recently many politicians have discussed the prospect of legalizing Marijuana. But it seems until they have overwhelming public support, there will be no major change in the laws regarding Marijuana. The purpose of this passage is not to convince you to legalize marijuana or to more strictly enforce Marijuana laws. Rather, it's purpose is to inform you on all the facts about Marijuana. It is every American's right to make their own decision regarding govermnent policies, but unfortunately most people make their choices based on ignorance, or preconceptions. There is nothing wrong with choosing to make Marijuana illegal, as long as you have justifiable reasons for doing so.\nThe first thing to look at when deciding about a stance on Marijuana, the history of Marijuana in the United States. Marijuana was made federally illegal in 1937. In 1980 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began prescribing THC pills, (THC is the active ingredient in Marijuana, the one that produces the \"higW'), to control nausea in cancer patients. The FDA has also recently prescribed Marijuana cigarettes to suffers of glaucoma, in order to increase appetite. In 1988, the DEA's (Drug Enforcement Agency) concluded that \"marijuana is one of the safest, therapeutically active substance known to man.\" More than 400,000 people (in the US), are arrested each year on marijuana charges.\nThe next step in formulating an opinion, is to examine the physical effects it has on the body. Some short term effects of smoking Marijuana include, the \"high\", and increased heart rate, and some loss of coordination. Long term effects are similar to those of cigarettes, mouth, throat, lung cancer, and bronchitis. Also, those who are chronic smokers, (more than once a day), show signs of short term memory loss after smoking.\nAfter the physical effects are realized we must look at exactly what Marijuana does to the mind. \"There are no obvious personality defects among those who use the drug on occasion\", according to Pgychology and You, by McMahon and Romano.","num_words":381}

The First Amendment gave those teachers the right to choose their text books but their rights were waived under an previous agreement with the school district.\nAs if it were not enough that the teaching curriculum and student's education is immensely limited because of constant attempt of groups such as CEE, Blackstone Society, and Rutherford Institute, many public libraries are feeling the strain.","num_words":391}

The understanding which is pursued by ethnic American writers seems to be the correct pathway from which harmony between cultures can be achieved, and it is easy to establish such a common ground from the insight gained by reading minority works of literature. Because the knowledge is conveyed in a familiar language, through a familiar medium of text, the reader is given time in which to accept his own misconceptions and to rearrange his own thoughts in order to more effectively deal with a world of many different cultures.\nEven though the United States encompases people who speak a wide variety of languages, most commonly it is the English language which is spoken and, therefore, with which an American citizen feels most at ease. Most of the ethnic works of literature are, then, translated into English, and although some critics feel as though this distracts the reader from the true nature of the story, it is important that as many people as possible receive the messages the work contains. Instead of feeling challenged, even threatened by tackling a novel written in another language, the reader readily accepts the content of the work simply on its appearing not to be different from one he might have written himself. The readers may not have such an easy time dealing with the insights the works of ethnicity present, however his mind, opened initially through the use of a common language, will not discard the thoughts without regarding them in some new way. Although works such as Like Water for Chocolate were initially written in the author's native language, their cultural potency is certainly not lost in the translation. In the Joy Luck Club, the reader quickly notices the choppy English which the Chinese mothers speak, and Celie's black slang and strange inflections in The Color Purple serve to contribute to the reader's sense of participation in the action.

But a persons heritage, as we are realizing, is important to their sense of self and community. Ethnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen. The differences they are rediscovering only add more color, flavor and excitement to that brewing \"pot\" of our people. However, some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion (seen most clearly through the arts). They don't want to accept these differences. They choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans. As Ellie Weisel, author of such books as Night says about indifference: it is the opposite of everything good. The opposite of love, beauty, intelligence, light, joy, life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference. Ethnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly & uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture.\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds. Each group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it's writing unique. In many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \"mother tongue\". For instance, Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment. Chinese American Literature is philisophical\/literal because their native language is so. African American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music. All these examples (and more) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know. \nThe stories told in this genre of literature, however, are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature. It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States. When we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity. The stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference.

The protagonist is singled out among the characters of the ethnic literature to convey the purpose of the author's work. Ethnic American literature implies that the ethnic protagonist's search for an identity within a society is not to set him apart from his culture selfishlessly, but to achieve, excell, and contribute to the culture of which he is associated. The protagonist is confused as to his role within society, but searches for that identity and role for the benefit of the many.\nThe protagonist is challenged by society to prove his value as an existing member. In that challenge, the character is faced with an examination of his or her role within the society. Celie, the protagonist of The Color Purple, must find inner strength to overcome the hardship placed on her by the male society. The desired result of the character's quest is not material wealth or spontaneous gratification, but a freedom to make a difference. Elie Wiesel pointed out that his autobiographical work Night was written to present a detailed account of the Jewish experience in the Nazi concentration camps, not to promote his own achievement in surviving. The important issue to examine in a protagonist's journey against society is the deference of gratification to the entire culture. The search for identity is based on the quest to break away from the social injustice to find self-worth.","num_words":258}

Each of these characters battles against the naturalistic effects of white versus Native American thinking. should they form a tribal family, or a nuclear one? should they worship God, or Gods? And do they respect the government, or themselves? Each of these questions is representative of naturalistic battles going on in the character's lives. The same can be said for the characters in Philip Roth's works. A recurring theme faced by many of the characters is how to exist in the modern world and still retain the beliefs and discipline of the Jewish faith. These conflicts arise simply from the fact that these people were born Jewish, a situation that has great influence but is clearly beyond their control.\nWomen, in particular, find it difficult to accept the stereotypical roles assigned to them, and I can hardly blame them. I can see no reason why Celie should find contentment in cooking and cleaning for M.- jus so he can reward her by beating her some  more. Should Tita be happy? I find no cause for rejoicing in the fact that she is not allowed to marry and must watch her true love marry her sister in order to service the selfish needs of Moma Elena.

However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.\n\nIn the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mother's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show. This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature cannot be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.\n","num_words":357}

Unfortunately, many ethnic American cultures are segregated from mainstream society into unsafe urban slums and face a more dangerous way of life. By reading the literature that deals with the violence of ethnic American cultures, one gains a new perspective on life in our country. It is important to understand the lifestyles and struggles of our fellow man especially of those in our own \"backyards\". People like Joseph Zaitchik respond to this condition of ethnic American literature by saying <*>. I wholeheartedly disaggree. Reading about violence, whether fiction or real, does not make one more violent. It encourages the learning process and allows the reader to experience the emotions involved without actually experiencing the action. Though violence is not a easy topic to face up to, it is one that the United States needs to confront.\nStatistics show that ethnic American cultures (such as African American, Native American, and Latin American) have higher rates of crime, homicide, alcohol abuse, and domestic violence than non-ethnic groups. Violence then, is a part of their everyday lives. For what ever reasons, these American cultures face a difficult reality which some feel the need to express through writing.\nMost ethnic American writers are from the situations they write about; they've experienced the violence first-hand and want to pass it on to their readers. Sometimes they need to write just to express their pain or unsure feelings, though, more often, their purpose is to teach a lesson. They use violence from realistic situations to make others aware of the problems in ethnic American cultures. This is necessary in the effort to change current conditions of our fellow man - we will not change what we do not car about and we will not care about what we do not understand.","num_words":314}

These characters provide a foil by which the reader can modify, adapt or reexamine the lifestyle or beliefs which he or she currently holds. \nThe power of ethnic American literature comes from the authors' abilities to provide vivid detail of the psychological nature of non-traditional, minority characters.

Love, passion, and hate are portrayed as emotions so powerful that they can drive entire cultures to unite, and at the same time, can torment even the lowest soul. This frankness and use of strong emotions provides us with a base on which we can reexamine our own feelings towards these emotions. Unlocking a hidden passion in a character can be as traumatic as a murder in our society, but this powerful emotion exudes strength and power in ethnic American literature. We are captivated by the characters' willingness to break out or release emotion because of the social norms placed on our white American society.

According to l'Academie Français, all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics, including sex, violence, church, and state issues. Another standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude, making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time, setting and plot true to life. Voltaire, as a Neoclassicist, knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature.  However, when writing Candide, Voltaire defied the Academie's rules. Candide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism.  \nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners: they did not want to step on anyone's toes by mentioning sex, violence, church, or state issues. In Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact, he did not mind smashing feet! Voltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex. He told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys, and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act. Sex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber, and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her. The wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates, as well as experiencing rape. After the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman, he receives 100 lashes for his sin. Candide stabs the Baron, a Jesuit Priest, after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde. Ironically, although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence, each act is treated lightly: Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating; and after Candide \"kills\" the Baron, he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels.

The factors involved in this occurrence is mostly the fact that frustration (especially denial of a goal soon to be obtained) leads to aggression. We are more likely to be involved in arguments which involve frustration with people we know and come in contact with.

Obviously the 1st brother doesn't expect to be shot so he continues to harass the other. The boy with the gun only wants him to stop, not to die but all of a sudden the trigger has pulled the finger.

All this makes the train less appealling to the general public, and, in particular, the commuter.\nAnother problem is that of understaffing, both on trains and at stations. This leads to an increase in fare dodging, which is now quite possible unintentionally - with ticket offices closed at both ends of the journey, and no guard, who are you supposed to pay?\nAll this leads to trains being unprofitable, except on a few major commuter routes. Many things have been tried to reverse this, but to no avail. Closing small lines which regularly lose money may seem sensible but leads to less people getting trains in general - after all if you have to drive twenty miles to the nearest station, you might as well just drive to wherever you are going. Increasing or decreasing prices could be tried, but as trains are more expensive than cars for most journeys anyway, this would have little effect. \nThe only way to make profits is to get more people on trains, and this requires an improvement in services. This would initially cost a lot, and unfortunately sufficient funding is never available. \nAs more and more people use cars, traffic in city centres during rush ours comes to a near standstill. More cars arrive, get stuck in jams, and spread the congestion further and further out of the city, until motorways and bypasses become blocked.\nThe problem is obvious - there are too many cars on Britain's roads. There are two ways around the problem - reduce the number of cars, or build more roads.\nIn cities, where all traffic jams start, there is no room for more roads - every square yard is already in use. The only place more roads can be built is outside cities, building more and wider motorways.","num_words":396}

It has even been attempted to build more roads for the cars to travel on, but it seems that the number of cars increases on the road increase, making the problem the same as it was before. Lancaster is a very good example of a failed one way system. It is becoming more apparent that walking is faster at peak times of the day (ie 08:00 and 17:00). Resulting from this failure, a bypass was introduced but is used by very few cars, amounting to another failure.\nAlong with the traffic congestion, comes pollution. The green house effect is a major issue to most citizens but very few of them are prepared to give up their car to show it. The government however, is beginning to address this issue and the car manufacturers are placing catalytic converters on their newer cars. In areas such as Mexico City, the pollution is perfectly visible as a mass smog cloud can be seen enveloped over the city. These sites are also very common in the major American cities and even, at times, London.\nWith such are large no. of cars on the road, maintenance is another major issue. £ billions are spent by the government alone trying to keep the UK roads in as best a condition as possible.\nFinally, the number of accidents is rapidly increasing, along with he number of cars.

This large no. of cars is causing congestion and general \"wear and tear\" of our roads.\nThe easy access to cars has enabled people to move out of the polluted, \"grey\" cities and into out-of-town villages where they can commute. This has meant that whereas people used to walk or catch a bus to work they now drive into work. This is especially true in the major cities such as London and Birmingham and this can be seen in the horrific traffic problems which plague these cities. When faced with large traffic jams there is the tendancy to find shortcuts and this can lead to heavy traffic through rural villages or residential areas. The number of heavy goods vehicles on the road networks has also increased and frequent lorry traffic can damage roads not built for this purpose quickly. They also restrict the flow of traffic on motorways especially when in large numbers.\nThe rail transport in the United Kingdom also has many problems. One of these is the increasing number of people who prefer to drive rather than catch a train. This unpopularity has come about especially over shorter distances due to the delays and strike problems etc.\nThe privatisation and sell off of many of the more profitable networks such as the South East has lead to a profit-base operation meaning fewer trains, higher fares and the closure of many of the smaller stations.\nAnother problem is the unwillingness of industry to transport goods by train often due to the limited rail network and the cost compared to transport by HGV's.\nThe opening of the Eurotunnel, connecting the UK network to the rest of Europe, it is hoped, will stimulate the rail industry but a number of problems and Eurotunnel's increasing debt has done little to convince the general public.\nThere are many possible solutions to the problems I have identified many of which would compliment each other.

They feed endless diatribes onto the people who are too lethargic to care. They say that privatisation will lead to better service and prices.

Congestion is a severe problem, particularly in urban areas, where it is very difficult - almost impossible in fact -to create new road systems to cope with the taffic. A journey into Lancaster, for example, may only take ten minutes when the roads are quiet, but can take three-quarters of an hour during the 'rush-hour'. Congestion is certainly not a problem that will go away; the number of cars on Britain's roads is increasing constantly. The M25 has already been dubbed 'the biggest car-park in Europe', and if current trends continue, the number of cars using it will double by 2030.\nA huge amount of pollution is chewed out by all those cars, contributing to global warming, acid rain and smog in cities. Although catalytic converters are now compulsory on new cars, fumes in cities have become so bad that scientists have linked them to a marked increase in the number of asthma sufferers. The emissions from diesel vehicles - cars, buses and lorries - are particularly harmful (just watch a bus start its engine, and observe the huge black cloud that belches forth from its exhaust pipe), and yet there is no control on these vehicles' exhaust.\nHundreds of people are killed on the roads every year, and as cars become faster and taffic denser, the number of accidents will surely increase. Cars are also an extremely inefficient way of transporting people - large amounts of energy are used, and very often the car is only carrying one person. The number of lorries around is increasing, as more and more freight is carried by road (as opposed to sea or rail), due to the influence exerted by the road-haulage lobby on the government. Lorries create more noise and pollution than cars, and are much more damaging to the roads they travel on.\nNow that rail privatisation has gone ahead, many people are likely to lose faith in trains, due to the percieved inefficiency of the operators (for example the time-table book full of errors or the recent survey in Which? magazine about overcharging). Fares are likely to increase, and many rural lines that used to be subsidised by the government face closure.

In short a somewhat more radical, and unpopular, policy is required.\nBritish rail is notorously slow, late and expensive and the hype of rail travel and steam trains is long since gone with many old tracks being dismantled. If we are to alleviate the roads in Britain them we must encourage rail travel in Britain and we should be opening new lines not closing old ones. Perhaps the privatisation of British Rail will produce a more competitive service but I fear that it will will result in the closure of smaller less profitable lines and only a better service on the main routes. Why is British rail so unreliable? Most of the world besides Britain seems to run a reliable service even developing countries. Few efforts have been made to make the fares cheaper and a more desirable form of family travel, with the Family railcard really being a non-starter.\nUntil the rail service improves people will continue to use the ever increasingly clogged up roads. Simply widening and building new roads is not a solution as the number of cars on the roads simply increases to \"fill in the gaps\". With the Newbury bypass work now being stopped for 3 days running I can sympathise with the protestors.

The essay will have four sections too it. Firstly the main problems of road transport will be identified and this shall be followed by suggested solutions to these problems. The same format will be followed for rail transport, and as their problems are completely different in most respects, it must be clear that the arguments must be kept seperate. \nRoad transport includes a wide range of vehicles from bicycle to coach. Each carrying passengers on our roads to their destinations. The major problem of the road as a route to transport, is it can only with hold a certain number of vehicles at any time. In short this means, there is an ever increasing congestion problem on most British roads, whether they be motorway or 'A' roads. Country lanes and small 'B' roads shall be excluded from the purpose of this essay. \"Traffic Jams\" are on the increase. This is due to two main reasons. The first is that there are too many cars on the road, and secondy poor planning of road systems built before the extent of such congestion could be seen. One way systems have been installed in many cities, where careful planning of route ways, may have made it easier today. The extent of the problem is that too many vehicles want to use the same roads at the same time. The 'A' roads into city-centres are used very heavily in rush hours between seven o'clock in the morning to nine thirty and four to six thirty in the evening. These roads would be free at night. The same applies for motorways always congested at peak times during holiday seasons. The second major problem is that not many new roads can be built. Ever increasing numbers of protestors and environmentalists are blockading the paths of construction of 'by-passes', e.g. the Dwyford Downs. This is not a significant problem, but the areas where new roads are needed most are in the centre of massive cities where new roads can not be possibly constructed, there is simply not enough room.

The most talked about issues concerning road are probably congestion and safety. Congestion is most apparant around the major conurbations such as London, Greater Manchester and Birmingham. The simple way to solve this problem would be to either build more roads or make the present ones larger. However this, as seen in recent events for example Newbury, has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and local residents. another way to reduce congestion, especially in the large cities, could be to persuede people not to use their vehicles at all. Introducing schemes such as the 'park-and-ride' scheme and encouraging people to use bicycles would certainly reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSafety is often talked about as a priority factor concerning roads. Too many accidents occur because of dangerous driving on busy roads. There are several ways to combat this problem. Although the legal limit for drinking while driving has just been increased lowering the limit by several units would detere many people from using their own vehicles and instead encourage them to use public transport.\nIncreasing the amount of law enforcement could also be effective, giving the police more right to make arrests and increasing the number of speed cameras as well as possibly give larger fines. Cutting down on national speed limit may also encourage drivers to take more care. The condition of roads is often a local issue rather then of national concern. It is therefore up to the local council to maintain their roads better, especially in winter. This may require the local council obtaining more money from the government.\nSafety is much less of a factor for rail transport. Here the major talking point is efficiency. It is often noted that trains are delayed and are rarely running on time. Because of this inefficiency many of rails customers are turning to other forms of transport, cars mostly but for long distance journeys flying is an increasingly attractive option.\nA large amount of blame for this inefficiency goes to the actual trains which are in most cases out of date and slower then modern ones such as the French TGV or the Japanese 'bullet' train.","num_words":375}

While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train.

Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains.

For example, foxes could be controlled in some other way, an example could be a shotgun. A bullet to the head is a much more  moral way to kill this animal than to literally rip it to shreads. The farmers will then complain that they have nothing to do on a Sunday. This is where 'drag hunting' becomes involved.","num_words":397}

My reasons for this are as follows.\nFox hunting in my eyes is a brutal sport carried out by the higher classes in society. It is regarded by many people as being traditional and indeed the practice of fox hunting has been carried out for many years. However I regard fox hunting as a pointless and futile sport. In many ways it is looked upon as a blood sport. Once, the sport may have be necessary to cull the numbers of foxes but now foxes have become so rare that they are rarely seen in the wild.\nFoxes are simply hunted for fun and for trohpy's. They are not hunted out of necessity for food. Most farmers regard foxes as pests and occasionaly foxes do cause problems on farms by killing chickens or other farm birds. However this is their nature. They must eat to survive and to feed their young and it is only rarely that foxes sieze the opportunity to steal chickens from farms. Due to this many farmers give permission for fox hunting to take place on their land. Although foxes may harm farm animals this is only an instinct for survival. There seems to be no point in my eyes in killing a timid and rare animal. Their furs were widely sought after for the making of fur coats but now public opinion has put this to an end. \nI regard fox hunting as a pointless sport. There is a lot of pomp and tradition involved and dressing up. As well as the pointlessness of fox hunting it is too brutal on the now endangered wild fox population. The foxes are not really given a chance. Once one is spotted by the hunting party a pack of hounds is sent after it. All the fox can do is flee in desparation. It does not really stand a chance against the overwhelming odds of about twenty blood thirsty hounds. Occasionaly foxes to manage to escape or hide but in most cases when a fox is spotted once the dogs reach it, it will be torn to pieces.","num_words":395}

In today's society it is an outdated and barbaric \"sport\" which, in my opinion, should be banned. \nIn this country animal rights have been debated in parliment and many measures have been implemented to safeguard animals welfare. Recently the British government have brought in legislation with respect to how animals, which are going to be slaughtered, should be transported. These measures include the time the animals spend on the road, how much room they have etc. etc. However it is still perfectly legal for a group of people to chase a fox with a pack of dogs and watch them chase the fox until it is exhausted and then get torn apart by the dogs. This, apparantly, is a sport.\nThe Government has made it illegal for dogs to attack badgers whilst it is still legal for dogs to attack foxes. Surely this is unfair and hypocritical of the government. It is also illegal for two dogs to attack each other for the enjoyment of the spectators. At least if one dog fights another the fight is, in some, fair. But it is still perfectly legal for an infinite number of dogs to attack a single fox for the enjoyment of others. The fox stands no chance, why is fox hunting legal whereas all other blood sports are banned.\nFox hunting is, for the most part, enjoyed by the upper-class. It is expensive to partake in as you need a horse, dogs and riding equipment (eg. helmet, boots etc.) you also need land to do it in. It is my opinion that the conservative government will not ban fox-hunting because it will loose the support and funding from its upper class, wealthy supporters who fox hunt.\nIn a time when Britain has very few surviving wild animals surely something should be done to protect the fox. The British government is always among the first countries to support the protection of wild animals in other countries (eg. when banning whaling) and they are very ready to attack countries who do kill wild animals (eg. the destruction of habitats in the Brazillian rain forests).","num_words":368}

Are blood sports acceptable in todays society?\nThen again, should foxhunting be classed as a sport. The fox, by its nature, is a menace to farmers as it is a carniverous predator and will eat the farmers smaller livestock. Therefore foxhunting has the purpose of a modern day 'pest control company' whose role is to exterminate rodents and pests. There are however organised leisure fox hunts for fun and I am sure that the participants enjoy themselves immensely. No doubt most of the fun is had in the chase and not the kill. Therefore perhaps like fishermen (leisure), the prey could be caught and then released. Unfortunately the hounds won't see it this way!\nThe pursuit of fox hunting comes under a lot of attack from pressure groups. Protests are all very well but the protesters have taken it too far recently. In the 1st week of the New Year a man and his wife were beaten up severely by a gang of protestors in front of their two young children. by doing this the protestors are taking the law into their own hands and whats more are violating the very laws of inhumanity which they so ardently stick up for.\nBy banning fox hunting the law would probably drive the sport 'underground' as it were and the participants would find some way around it.

There are many people trying to stop the sport taking place. The reason why people kill and hunt foxes is because they kill chickens and because they enjoy the social side of the sport. In this present time I am sure farmers can come up with some idea to prevent the fox's getting at his chickens. If they did this then there would not be a need for killing foxs and going on hunts. When hunts take place other wildlife are harmed as well as the foxs. Some homes of animals may be destroyed and some inocent animals may be harmed. Once the foxs are caught it is said that they suffer a horrible death and if this continues it will be unfair. Many people have no problems with foxs and the hunt should not be included as a sport, as it will not be fun to experience. If fewer foxs are killed it means that there will be fewer rabbits around to destroy the crops so this will be a benefit to a lot of farmers and this is not cruel, it is just the way of life. Fox hunting is a horrible sport as the fox is hunted down by a pack of dogs and men on horseback. The fox is then chased until it is caught. Thinking about this is very upsetting and most people would be relieved if fox hunting was banned. Foxs have as much right on this earth as we do and I am sure we can deal with the situation in a different way. I am sure nobody will want to go through what a fox goes through on a hunt so I do not see why we should put foxs through it. If foxs are unable to harm farm animals there is not a danger in banning the sport.\nThe reason why fox hunting should continue is to keep the amount of foxs down and not causing a change in the food chain. Foxs are not needed to keep down the rabbit population as farmers are able to use poisons to kill off the rabbits.

The day that the Government starts to ban popular sports like boxing is the day I apply for American citizenship. The only argument of those who are for the banning of the sport is the fact that in the past few years there have been three incidents in Britain which have left one boxer dead and two others with brain damage. These men were professionals, they were not stupid. All boxers know the risks and are surrounded by people who are trained to look after them. Boxing is a high risk, short term career the men who do it are aware of this, that is why they are paid so highly. I recently read a report that stated that football players who play full back or centre forward in non-league football are more prone to long term head injuries than boxers because they often go without treatment and without taking precautions when they get concussed. This is cleer evidence that without the large sums of money envolved boxing would be far more dangerous because the medical care would be poorer. So, those that say the money pushes these boxers to their fates may be wrong in thinking so because it is the money which protects them in a way.\nHow could we ever ban a sport as full of skill and traditional values (such as good sportsmanship) as boxing is beyond me.

They say that boxing should be banned because the only way to stop these accidents happening is to stop boxing, and the only way to stop people boxing is to ban boxing and make it illegal. \nThe illegalisation of boxing I believe however could only lead to the introduction of underground boxing matches if out of sight of the law.

One hit alone is unlikely to injure or kill a boxer, but continual hitting can severely damage the brain. The brain is surrounded by protective fluid. This fluid is gradually worn down, and eventually leaves the brain tissue with very little protection, making it suseptable to serious damage.\nBoxers, and boxing fans alike, argue that an average fight may only last six 3 minute rounds, and during this they may only get hit 100 times in this 18 minute period. A proffesional boxer usually only has about 3 fights a year, which, he argues, means he only receives 300 hits to the head. However, this is not true. A boxer spends many hours sparring in the ring in preparation for each of these fights. He may receive thousands of hits to the head during sparring, which could seriously damage his health. \nAlso, there is a moral issue at stake. Many people believe that boxing is a blood-thirsty sport, and it should not be allowed in modern society. The sole intention of a boxer is to hit his opponent so hard that he can't continue to fight on. Boxers may train for up to 6 hours a day building up their strength to enable them to use their arms as powerful weapons against other fighters.\nHowever, despite the highly publicised deaths of some fighters, for example James Murray who died recently in a boxing match, boxing has a much lower mortality rate than some other sports, e.g. horse riding or motor car racing.

We have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis, Nigel Benn, Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno.\nDespite being enjoyable to watch, boxing is very dangerous. Blows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor.\nLast year, the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months. Many youths in low income areas see boxing as 'a way out', a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way. There are, however, people who regard boxing as barbaric, brutal and primitive. These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence.\nDuring the fight, yes, of course it is violent, but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other. All precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight. During fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required. Ambulances are also kept on stand by at big events. Although it may sound cruel, I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks.\nBecause there are so many budding young boxers, to ban boxing would be insane, since it would almost certainly go underground. Underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually isn't a doctor present.\nTaking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent, it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport. Although far less popular, there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous, such as 'Thai Boxing', where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows.\nThe argument continues, but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned.

He had suffered a major blot clot in his brain and after serious surgery and over eight months I hospital, he was left unable to walk without support and with a serious speaking disorder. One young man's life smashed by just a twelve round fight. Nearly one year ago another man, McClellan, was also left in a critical condition after his fight with Eubank. He is still in hospital  to this day, recovering. The most recent incident which has fuelled the debate has been the death of the young Scotsman - James Murray. After suffering a brain haemorage during his World Championship defence, he was left in a coma with serious brain damage. He died later the next day. These three events are only a fraction of the incidents occuring in a boxing ring which have caused controversy over the sport.\nA boxer's risks do not stop when he retires. Sure, he hasn't been injured badly during his fights, but every time he has been hit during his several years in the sport, a slight bit of damage has been done to his brain. This damage has built up every fight and the boxer is ore likely, even though he doesn't perticipitate in the sport any more, to have a brain haemorrage or a stroke. They are also very likely to suffer, in their old age, from a serious and sometimes fatal disease called Parkinson's disease. It affects the nervous system very badly and can lead, in some cases, to paralysation. Is this kind of a risk really worth a life in the sport of boxing?\nThere are, however, many reasons why the sport of boxing should not be banned.

Firstly it is an argument directed against the government, for attempting to raise taxation, without actually introducing a new tax. The government is well aware how bitterly unpopular taxation is and, therefore, objections raised against the lottery concerned it being marketed as a game, while being in reality, merely an additional source of revenue for the government. Not only was the government criticised for taking any money from the lottery, but also for the size of its share - inevitably taking money from the lottery's 'good causes'. The objection raised to the lottery of it being 'a tax on the stupid' was secondly directed against its marketing. It was argued that the marketing companies  emphasised the likelihood of winning the market despite the statistical probabilities against this. The slogan of the National Lottery, 'it could be you' came under intense criticism. \nHowever, recent studies have shown that the vast majority of people speak reasonably of  the lottery, certainly not above the amount they can afford on their income. The fears that many people, duped into believing they had a realistic chance of a large win, would spend more than they could afford, appear to be groundless. These studies have shown that spending on the lottery increases as income increases -  the poor spend the least, the rich spend the most. Clearly, there are not as many stupid people in Britain as those critics objecting to the national lottery originally claimed. As far as the criticism directed against the government is concerned, there was never any concealment of the money going to the government. all other forms of gambling are taxed, as is the majority of our spending with Value Added Tax. It would be unreasonable to expect that the government would not tax the lottery.\nThe lottery was also criticised for misrepresentation of the areas and amounts into which the lottery money would be broken down. This objection was levelled above all at the lottery's 'good causes' - the charities in particular. It was argued that the amount of money going to charity had been amphasised too much and the figures exaggerated. Thus, it was argued, donations to charity would be heavily hit by the introduction of the lottery.","num_words":388}

Judging from experiences abroad (such as Spain and the USA) the lottery was most popular with people who saw it as their only way to escape a lifetime of poverty. Stuck in the poverty trap, where any wages are offset by the twas in benifits,  it was predicted that people would spend money they couldn't afford on a gamble they had no chance in winning. Early research centred on inner city areas with high unemployment indicates that on average, regular participants of the Lottery spend about £10 a week.\nMany critics of the Lottery felt that because a proportion of the profits were going to be given to good causes, people would  be 'conned' into playing the Lottery because they would think they had been giving money to charity. It is now known that only eight pence in the pound has been given to good causes, and this has also resulted in another of the warnings being proved correct; that donations to legitimate charities has significanlly fallen since the introcution of the Lottery.\nOpposition to the lottery by betting shops was disregarded by many but the popularity of other forms of gambling have also fallen since the Lottery's introduction. This has resulted in many betting shops having to close down, resulting in unemployment. The fear of a nation of gamblers was one which caused many people to be opposed to the lottery, and its massive popularity seems to indicate to this. Especially considering that traditional non-gamblers are gambling on a bet where the odds are 14 million to one.\nPrior to the Lottery's implementation, no one knew where all these profits were going to go. It is now clear that the majority has gone straight into Camelot's pockets, and if the Lottery is to continue, I feel that their cut of the profits should be lessened, especially considering Virgin were prepared to run the Lottery as a publicity exercise, and giving all the profits to the government.","num_words":349}

The vast majority saw the idea as an exciting one and were interested in taking part in such a large-scale competition where such huge amounts of money were at stake. However, some people saw the lottery as a bad thing which would tend to become a hopeless addiction. These people tended to be those whose ideas and actions the general public are expected to follow; such as church leaders, or members of Parliament.\nThe arguments which these people suggested were numerous. Firstly, the amount of money which the jackpot winners were likely to receive was deemed as 'too much' or even 'unseemly'. The objectors felt that such a large amount of money (up to £9 million on any normal lottery draw) was too much to be given to just one party. The recent 'double rollover' jackpot fund gave a figure of £42 million which, theoretically, could have gone to just one lucky winner. This was deemed by the Bishop of Durham as 'an obscene amount of money', and many other members of the religious fraternity agreed and made their thoughts on the matter public.\nSecondly, many people believe that the amount of the cost of each ticket which goes to various charities is far too little. At present this stands at 5%. People feel that this amount is not enough, especially as one of the main reasons for the introduction of a British national lottery was the issue of raising funds for home charities and needy causes.\nThis issue is coupled with the profit margin which the lottery organisers, Camelot, obtain.

Since the first draw it has become increasingly popular involving millions of people across the country each week. The proposal of a lottery brought about many obejctions and complaints;\nThere were, and still are, two principle concerns the Anti-National Lottery Campaigners still have. For people living in high society a 'flutter' on the National lottery each week has no effect on their financial position. These kind of people can afford to spend £10-20 a week. The concern lies for the, and I use the term lightly, 'working class citizens'. These people work hard throughout the year and cannot afford to spend copious amounts of money on the lottery. The problem is, these working men and women and un-employed men and women do spend money they can't afford.\n\nThe second of the two problems is the encouragement of gambling. The National Lottery after all is another gambling game. The probability of winning the jackpot is approximately 1 in 14 million and the probability of winning ten pounds is 1 in 58. It is gambling, but more importantly it is gambling made available to 16 year olds. A lot of the gambling problems tend to lie with the scratch cards associated with the lottery. These are easily purchased and the attraction is winning on the spot. The thought ov being rich instantly encourages gamblers young and old and under-age to purchase tickets.\n\nThe National Lottery however has its good points. There is one main advantage to the lottery. It has helped charities and societies around the country to achieve things which would otherwise have been impossible. From buying a young child with brain problems a very expensive piece of stimulative equipment to building a new village hall for a small community in the Shetland islands, the lottery has helped young and old, far and wide.\n\nThe lottery has also created jobs, encouraged spending and has made many people have happy dreams about what it would be like to be rich.\n\nThe National lottery has its good points and its bad points.

The basic principlees behind the lottery are that a small  number of people are able to become monumentally rich from the contributions of many. Despite objections, the vast majority of lottery players see it as harmless fun which won't break the bank.\nThe main objection to the lottery is based on the grounds that those who play it most are those who can afford it the least. Many Britons are in situations of poverty where the lack of employment prospects and the deterioration of the welfare state means that the lottery is seen as the only way to solve their problems. The idea that the 'quick fix' can turn their lives around seems to mask the fact that they are spending what they cant afford. By the laws of averages, the population stands to lose out as only fifty per-cent of money is allocated to the prizes. It is believed that the only winners will be the government who take a cut, camelot - the organisers - and the small number of participants who 'get lucky'. Many argue that the spread of wealth across Britain is uneven enough as it is. The Lottery would create more 'super-rich' people whilst reducing the financial capabilities of those at the lower end of the spectrum.

Richard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity, but was rejected.

For example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house. The lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood: stealing from the poor to give to the rich.\nThe lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive, especially with the introduction of scratch cards.

Consequently many people who may have otherwise not gambled, become addicted to gambling.\nSecondly, gambling is indulged in by a large number of people on lower incomes, who attempt to win prizes to improve their low standard of living. Due to the massive sizes of some of the Lottery jackpots many people are persuaded to spend large proportions of their income on trying to win an amount of money that would considerably change their life.\nAnother critisism is of the size of the jackpots themselves. Many people believe that the size of the main prizes are so great that winners find it difficult to comprehend the amount of money they have won and consequently it is often spent or invested unwisely. Also because of the amount of money won winning the Lottery jackpot can often run peoples lives. Many people claim, after winning a jackpot, you slowly lose friends and can become completely cut off from the lifestyle you were previously used to. In fact it is claimed that the only way to keep friends is to not mention that you have won the jackpot.\nHowever the Lottery also has its beneficial aspects: The lottery raises an enormous amount of revenue for the Government, which would otherwise to have been raised through increased taxes. This money is mostly then invested into important institutions by the Heritage Fund. Consequently it has enabled the survival of many theatres and other places of historic and cultural interest. Another positive point is that the Lottery is entirely voluntary; those who disapprove need to pay.\n Also the lottery helps to retain small shops and newsagents from being 'chased out of business' by bigger chains and supermarkets. The Lottery organiser, Camelot decided to only sell the lottery tickets from small shops and post-offices to increase their trade and also they gain some of the revenue (around 5p in every £1) from the tickets.\nClearly the National Lottery has its positive and negative aspects.","num_words":386}

Of course charities were expecting a reasonable share but who else? Varioius organisations expressed interests in receiving funds, with application being made to the National Heritage Office. Some money was to be kept to build a series of monuments to the start of the next millenium. Many people agreed with this but did not wish to see any 'White Elephants' constructed.

Computers have also been blamed for a fall in education standards among primary school children; a belief accentuated by the results of surveys which state that the vast mayority of primary school children are unable to do simple arithmetic in their minds and rely on another computer, the calculator, to help them.\n\tAnother moral dilemma that computers have created is their role in the workplace. There are many people who fear that computers will eventually replace man in the workplace. The role of computers is already significant in employment areas, such as accountancy, which require a specialist ability to be able to calculate and manipulate numbers. These computers have replaced humans and such changes have sparked fears that the level of unemployment could vastly increase as a result. As the computers are: more efficient than humans, do not require payment for their work, are less temperamental than humans and will never have a day off because it is ill, it seems mankind is faced with a great problem.\n\tAnother claim made that suggest the human brain could become useless is that computers promote anti-social behaviour. The creation of the World Wide Web and the Internet have created concern that the human race will become unsociable. The Internet allows you to correspond with people all over the world and it also contains many other functions to, supposedly, make life easier for us. The Internet also has another fundamental problem according to many.","num_words":385}

This has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations, and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer. This, unfortunately, means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator, who needs only to know which buttons to press. This may seem an extreme view, as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer cannot calculate, but this may not be the case centuries into the future.\n\tComputers have been used as a means of keeping records, they have all but superseded handwritten text, (in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam), they are used to transfer money across the globe, even to create artwork and to entertain. Computer generated pictures, including `fractal' pictures, drawn from equations, seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist's imagination, and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real, physical world. Virtual reality allows people to have `3-D' entertainment created for them by a computer.\n\tWhether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain, it has certainly made the human body all but redundant. People, businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines, e-mail and the internet, and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face. Money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage doesn't matter, it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of.\n\tHowever, the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true(!)

Such developments have both made the human brain more dependent upon the computer as its increased usage has made various parts of the brain lazy. On the other hand the discoveries made by computers have stimulated the human brain to further fields of thought. However, which has a greater effect on us and why depends much on our circumstances.\n\tIn the world today children are taught about things which have only come to light as a result of the technological revolution, namely the computer. For example the nature of the sun's surface has been made available by computer technology. This provides simple additional information not requiring the brain to think much, unless one is able to think around it such as in companion to other planet's surfaces. Therefore, the human brain whilst dependent upon its data from the computer is able to establish more lines of thought and expand its capacity. However it is also important that children do not become overreliant upon computers from an early age as they will not have the chance to develop their own brain in doing subjects, such as mathematics. However as more and more children become acquainted with computers their brain becomes lazier in carrying out even the simplest of tasks. Therefore, the child must be taught to be independent before being introduced to computers by which it may expand its knowledge and understanding.\n\tIndeed computers are simply the result of what humans know and thus have instructed the computer to do. They are man-made and thus have been established by our own brain power, and so have been programmed with a similar line of thought. This argument could point to computers as the replacement of human brains yet their development is similar to ours, as we programme them according to the knowledge which we acquire. Therefore, the human brain should be able to understand a computer's programme and line of thought as being similar to its own. This point of view displays the computer as a substitute for a human brain which, once skilled in its use, is a major problem in its use by many people.\n\tHowever to those in complex fields such as physics the computer has been able to stimulate the human brain on to further research.","num_words":398}

Robotic production of cars, for example, allowed many firms to increase their efficiency and productivity. On the other hand, the advent of computer usage in the home could be argued to increase educational levels. As supply in computers through changing technology arrived, so demand was to gradually increase in the long term, both for the individual and for the firm. This long term change in demand can be charted to see if it has lead to a drastic fall in the usage of the human brain.\n\tAs I have said, changing technology has allowed factories to use robots for production. It has also created the internet, a global forum linking every part of the world up so that information can be passed on more easily. Similarly, the computer has also brought society video games, in the form of companies such as Sega and Nintendo. We must ask if such video games are detrimental to the youth of the world and also its population, or whether they relieve stress and form part of modern life. They do utilise the brain, testing reaction times and lateral thinking skill, but is this escapism a good or a bad thing?

This BSE has been known to cross the animal barriers; several sheep have had a similar disease after eating feed made from the reminants of dead, meatstripped cows. Now, scientists fear that it has crossed the boundary between cows and humans, as there are more and more cases of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD) appearing more frequently. There is, as of yet, no cure for this disease, and the only way humans could contract it would be by eating beef products. This clearly has put a lot of people off beef, as the press also had coverage of the inefficient quality control by the government, and the fact that this has been going on for years is worrying. The disease can take upto 15-20 years to become evident in humans, so even if people gave up beef today, they will have a chance of getting CJB. However, to give up the products now would reduce the chances of being crippled by this disease in the future. \nIf a lot of people did give up beef products, this will have had effects on the agricultural industry. Cattle farmers will be hit particularly badly if no-one wants to buy their meat. It will affect other animals being sold for meat also; more people will want to buy the meat from sheep and pigs and so-on so they can still eat the same amount of meat. The whole episode may send the price of beef down so people will buy it and take the risk (which must be tiny) rather than forking out for more expensive meat products. If no-one wants to eat beef then cows will only be bred for their milk, which means there will be less cows in the future possibly.

C.J.D, in its worst cases, can cause death, however, they majority of cases involve severe damage to the brain, leaving most sufferers totally dependant on others. It is also the case, however, that the link between the consumption of British beef and C.J.D has certainly not been proven, infact from testing on mice it seems unlikely. Even though figures have risen in the U.K concerning the number of deaths resulting from C.J.D, this is considered by most experts to be merely due to the advances in medical technology so that they are now able to diagnose more cases, which would have previously gone unreported.

However, symptoms may not appear until several years after the initial onset of disease. People questioned: \"If there are no symptoms, how do we know that no infected animals are getting into the food chain?\" The government reply was along lines of: \"Our safety precautions are enough to ensure that no infected beef is eaten,\" i.e. a blank response that didn't clarify the issue and in fact raised suspicion that there was a problem. Then a recent T.V. documentary proved that not only were infected animals sent for slaughter, but that safety precautions were inadequate and BSE was being sent to shops across the country.

Normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy.

Nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her. It is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30-40 year old parents, its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child. Also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child.

This means that any responsibility he\/she may feel for his\/her actions is shifted to their employers\/sponsors. This effect has been studied for many years and several well-documented experiments show the effect clearly. It has been shown to have been present in world war 2; when German troops killed Jews they did not hold themselves responsible as they had been told to do it, they had been set on the course by someone else. Similarly, the people in command in many scientific situations easily commit themselves to decisions because there is no immediacy for them, i.e. they rarely see their decisions face-to-face. Using the analogy of the persecution of the Jews in ww2 again, it was said that Goebbels was physically sick when he actually visited the concentration camps and saw what happened but could still order the camps to carry out their work because he had no sense of immediacy of the situation when he was sat in his office in Berlin.\n\tThis is all very interesting you may say, but these geneticists must feel some moral obligation.

But looking at these, are they really as good as they sound?

Einsteins work layed down the theoretical basis for nuclear weapons, and the implementation of the nuclear weapons program provided the catalyst for the development of nuclear electricity generation. can we blame Einstein for this.\n\tThis brings out several points: in a non money motivated world it is highly likely that if one scientist forsees dangers of his discoveries, he will discontinue it, he cannot however prevent others continuing his work, and he cannot ensure that the disoveries will not be made by others. In the real money motivated world, these are two pressures pushing him to continue his work, money being the most important: if he sees a potential monetary bonus, he is likely to contue his work. The other pressure is fame and the delight in being <?>. There are thousands of scientists who have achieved imortality through their work. All of this argument depends on the scientist seeing the potential dangers on his work. However, very often the scientist is blind to all the effects that his work may have. They often have an aim, a potential use for his work: it is likely that other implementations of his work are likely, and for the scientist difficult to see.\n\tAlso, how can a scientist take moral responsibility for a discovery made by pure luck. take this extreem example: a chemical researcher deliberately, without knowledge of its effects, mixes chemicals which result in the production of an unknown but deadly <?> gas which kills the entire staff of his research department. As the scientist is not at the fore front of his sience, the death of his collegues is not his fault.","num_words":393}

This technique has been of great benefit to the human race, enabling the production of more food, better food and new and interesting varieties of food. Of course, it is not just food that has benefited from selective breeding - the development of different natural fibres such as wool and cotton has been aided by it.\n\tIt is only in very recent times that genetic manipulation has been seen to have bad as well as good sides. This is because we are now at the stage where scientists can alter an organism by changing its genes in some way. I do not believe that the scientists who originally began research into the nature of genetics had any idea that it would one day be put to bad (or good) use - they simply wanted to find out what it was all about, and hence cannot be blamed for any later events.\n\tToday, much research is being carried out on human genes to find out how they work, and whether they can be altered to prevent diseases. The scientists who work on this cannot be blamed if someone else uses their technique for less philanthropic ends - for example, in biological warfare, or to elimante a 'gay' or 'criminal' gene which may be present in human embryos.\n\tWhere scientists can be blamed, however, is in the case of genetically engineered tomatoes. These are now available in a supermarket near you, with their genes altered to increase their redness, juiciness or resistance to disease. These tomatoes are probably perfectly safe, but if they, or some other genically engineered food, proves to cause a terrible disease, than that is the fault of the scientist who developed them, because they did not test them adequately to make sure they were safe. Similarly, if genetically engineered vaccines or medecines prove to have harmful side-effects, that is because they were not adequately tested before being released into the market, and the scientists are to blame.\n","num_words":349}

This will enable scientists to know precisely what each gene does. With this information certain genes can be searched for in the foetus and if detected the genes can be replaced with normal genes instead of the diseased ones.\n\tGenetic Engineering is used today as a sa<?> of substances, deficient in some humans. An example of this is insulin production. The human gene for insulin production was inserted into plasmids for circular loops of DNA found in Bacteria) along with an antibiotic resistance gene which killed of other bacteria leaving behind the bacterea containing the insulin gene. This bacteria was then left to reproduce, producing insulin throughout its life time. This insulin is then extracted and given to diabetics. This process is preferable to grinding down cow's livers. Processes such as this are invaluable to the treatment of certain diseases and conditions as they allow people infected to lead relatively normal healthy lives.\n\tGenetic Manipulation has been widely used in food production. Selective Breeding is a very simple example. Cows have been bred for milk and for their meat by simply breeding cows who produce lots of milk due to a genetic defect together eventually after many generations cows will be produced yielding much more milk than their offspring would need.\n\tCrops have been engineered to increase yields and resistance to draught, pests and disease.\n\tIn the future it will be possible to alter the physical and mental abilities of humans. This is immoral as superhumans would be created for specific jobs for example huge men with lots of muscle small heads and organs tucked away to produce fighting machines for war or for boxing.\n\tScientists will undoubtedly be able to do this in the future. This means that controls will have to be imposed to prevent this occuring leaving genetic engineering and genetic manipulation for allowing disadvantaged people become normal.

The trouble is that although a scientist may think he knows a lot about a particular area of study, and indeed he may, there is still so much that we do not know about about areas of study like genetics that there is a great fear of the unexpected. And indeed this fear is justified. When we consider the horrific effects of a nuclear holocaust I am sure there are many who wish it had never been discovered. But are we right to blame the scientists who first started the research and who had no ideas for it to be used as a weapon.\n\tWe can argue that surely the scientist must have the greatest realisation of the uses of the discovery good or bad since he is the expert on the subject.

Can we expert a scientist to bear this additional burden for the whole world?

Starting with the good aspects, however, since this is the fundamental usage of genetic engineering.\n\tThe story that hit the scientific press about two years ago was about the \"Stay-ripe\" tomato. It was an ordinary tomato which had genes from a wheat variety added to it creating a tomato that, once ripe, stayed red for weeks. This is a major advantage to supermarket chains who often import their fruit from French suppliers. The problem with this is that it often goes bad in transport, and so it substandard when it arrived. The new tomato will not do this, so they get more tomatoes per cargo than otherwise they would have done.\n\tThere have also been stories about barley and other cash crops being treated, so that disease and pest resistance is inbedded in the genes. Some can even produce pesticides themselves, a characteristic aquired from another plant. These crops are ideal for third-world countries where their native crop usually is found, but is being destroyed by a pest which is out of control. They do not have the capital for large scale pesticide projects, so these plants are ideal. They could eben ve engineered to produce larger quantities.\n\tHowever, genetic manipulation can also be used to recreate dead organisms. Due to government restrictions, the creation or recreation of animal life is illegal, but it has been done with a type of clover, usually found in the south of France, but seemed to disappear completely.\n\tPeople who think genetic engineering is going to recreate dinosaurs, or create strange creatures are living in a dream world controlled by paranoia.

Therefore, a field used to rear a handful of cows could be used to grow cereals and feed 10 times as many people.\nCoupled with the health and animal rights reasons, there are a wide number of factors influencing why people may not consume beef.

The only plausible reason for people in the UK to cease to eat beef is the disease CJD. This disease is the human equivalent of 'MAD COW DISEASE' or BSE.\nIn recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of BSE. This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago. In the 1960's and 1970's, cows were given feed which included sheep (and their brains) in its ingredients. Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young.\nThere is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous, as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef. There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case. However, cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people. Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is. If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner, it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely.\nIf people in the UK were to cease to eat beef, the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating. Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount. This is because with the beef market destroyed, the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers. The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened, cow farmers would cease to exist entirely.\nHowever, when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead? The answer is pork, lamb and other meats. The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef. This would mean, that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef.","num_words":399}

It is believed the the disease may have originally come from sheep. There waste then being fed to cows which have generated a new form of the disease. There is at the moment no proof for or against the transmition of mad cows disease to humans. Some scientists argue that there is a distinct possibility and something needs urgently to be done, whereas others claim that tests on mice and other animals have shown that there is no possibility of humans developing the syndrome.\n\nThe problem could have a shattering effect on the agricultural industry as already many people and shools have refused to eat beef, the pace being accelerated by media hype.\n\nIt is going to be very difficult for the industry to turn the problem around and regain faith in beef products. The growing concern will quickly destroy any exporting which will lead to further losses so the problem is quite large.\n\nI believe that to improve this the industry will have to clean up its production lines and hygene. It is believed that the disease is only passed on from the brain and spinal column and so if this is removed properly then the risk of illness being passed on is removed. The carcass will have to be cleaned and cooked properly using clean knives etc. instead of washing the carcass in dirty water only changing it once a day.\n\nThese changes will have to come quickly and a large scientific backing will be required or the industry will risk collapsing as more and more people turn away from the possible dangers of infected beef.\n","num_words":296}

The so-called 'mad cow disease' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction, stumbling around drunkenly. Herds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further. Those cows which had been put down were not used for food. The disease infects the cow, and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain, and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat, the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take.\nThe human disease, Crentzfeld-Jacob disease, or CJD, is believed to be a human form of BSE, although no clear link has yet been established between the two. It is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise, or whether awareness of the condition is heightened, but more cases, from all ages have been diagnosed recently, and the disease is always fatal.\nThe government insists, perhaps correctly, that British beef is perfectly safe to eat. However, people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K., and many are abstaining from eating beef. Many schools have removed beef from their menus, substituting pork and chicken, and sales of beef have shown a decline. The implications for the beef industry could be rather serious, where everybody to boycott beef products. To compensate, beef prices have dropped, in attempts to sell more meat, but the public remains sceptical.\nIf beef continues to fall from favour, then the beef industry's future would be unclear. Beef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies, fruit gums, and of course stock cubes. Would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients?","num_words":320}
{"Filename":"alevels9.txt","essay_id":"<ICLE-ALEV-0007>","Human":"The main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB. This is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal. In cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat. The problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time, this being a viral disease. It can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers. The rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating, e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on. However the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef.\n\nAnother reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism, although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB.\n\nThese factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell. With global communications as good as they are now, it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it's safety.\n\nAlthough British farmers have learned to diversits, Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain. Wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made, substantial changes would be needed to change the situation.\n","num_words":328}
{"Filename":"alevels9.txt","essay_id":"<ICLE-ALEV-0008>","Human":"There has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD (Creutzfeldts-Jacob disease).\nBSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue (or offal as it is sometimes known). After a few reported cases of CJD, a similar form of the disease found in humans, it is know thought that 'mad-cow disease' (BSE) is the cause. Researchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans.\nThis claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness. Already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 %.\nAlthough scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef. customers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some 'dodgy' butcher trying to cut costs. As you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu. An example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest, pure beef and contain no offal.\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant. An outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up.","num_words":289}

For example there has been a constant stream of scares about BSE and CJD, (croytstelt Jacob Disease), so many in fact that much of the public has become blasé about such 'scientific' reports. for one such report to be taken to heart it would need the backing of the houses of parliament, and maybe the EEC. If this were to occur the effects on the British farming communities would be catastrophic. Although beef rules have been steadily dropping over the past decade beef still outsells many other varieties of meat foodstuff's, with the exception of poultry.\n\nThe U.K. has allways been very agriculturally bored, since time began allmost British people have been farming and central to this agriculture was, and is in some parts of the U.K., Beef. If people in the U.K stopped eating beef because of the dangers of disease then the farmers have no suitable market. It would be unlikely to sell in Europe and too costly to sell further afield, and other than human consumption beef has few major uses. Basically they would no longer be able to farm beef. Perhaps if they switched to other animals, e.g. sheep. Unfortunately the market is saturated with sheep.\n\nSo the farmers turn to other trades and after a long spell of recession they recover. Not only the farmers are affected however, the veterinarians, the drug companies, food suppliers etc all suffer a drastic cut in business and many would not survive, drug companies can shift to human needs but the vets, food processing plants would have difficulty to say the least.\n\nThere are not only financial catastrophies to take into account. Farming is a large part of our heritage and many farm buildings date back to the middle ages. Most of this would be lost as would the farming communities, the towns and villages around the farming areas would suffer, all <?> to the general downward spiral that would hit the economy + agricultural industry.\n","num_words":351}

Bulls which produce the beef sometimes can catch the disease BSE which makes them go mad this disease is then believed to be passed on to humans through beef causeing mental health problems.\nThe effect on the UK aggricultural industry would be devestating and the UK's aggricultural industry is one of the biggest beef producers. Also failure for the U.K. to eat beef would mean that no beef would be purchased abroad and so the industry would suffer extreamly. And furthermore the fall that Britain isn't importing beef means that other countrys would'nt want to import UK beef because there is no tradeing between the countrys. This would also mean the change from Beef farming to crops or pig farming which would mean the clustering of all the cows and then wastage of this meat. The industry would also require heavy government subsidys to start the industry running again and for the diversifying by previous beef farmers. But he stopping of the eating of beef would mean an increase in demand for crops, sheep, pigs e.t.c. therefore more of these would have to be produced and therefore increased purchase of livestock and crop seed. The agricultural industry could face a widescale collapse <?> if other country's follow Britain in not eating any beef.\nThe first thing which would be noticed it people stopped eatting beef as often would be a drastic reduction in the price of beef. Beef stock would no longer be purchased but instead farmers would try to sell beef stock. However farmers with crops would be trying to increase their field and also increaseing their prices as demand increases.\nThis therefore leads to the conclusion that if people cease to eat meat due to becoming vegetarians or because of the risk of their mental health followed by a slow death economic upset will occur. In otherwords the collapse of one part of the aggricultural industry and increased posit of other parts of aggricultural industry.","num_words":347}

This is not only having an effect upon the agricultural industry, but also the meat industry as a whole. The disease has been linked with many deaths throughout the UK, and its publication has slowly begun to bring the sales of British beef to a standstill.\nThere has been no attempt by the government to reveal the truth about the disease even though it has found that a vegetarian who has never been into contact with beef contracted the human form of 'mad cows desease' and died. This is one of the causes to why people are not buying beef or the local butches. People are scared of the consequences and the possibility of contracting the desease although there is no concrete evidence that humans can actually contract the desease from the meat.\nBeef has been given bad publicity by the press, and it is becoming a major concern with the public. There was also the same problem over salmonela in eggs, that nearly brought an end to the sales of eggs over the country because of bad publicity by the press. People were scared of purchasing eggs in case they contracted salmonella poisoning, but ther was no concrete proof. The industry began to pick up after it had all passed over, but it was a long time.\nThe publicity of the 'mad cow disease' means that farmers are having to be more aware of the condition of their cattle. It is only the older cattle which are able to contrat the desease, but it does mean that the cattle must be checked, and destroyed if they are found to have the desease.","num_words":292}

If it is then will it affect them? It may affect them but only in the long term or it may be irradiated in the cooking process. Too little is known at this stage due to the relatively recent introduction of BSE.\nIf the market for beef drops in the UK then there could be a drastic effect on agriculture as a whole. If people stop eating beef then there will be a surplus of cows in the UK. They will have to be slaughtered and be wasted, if they cannot be sold abroad. Veal is sold abroad, so as long as the foreigners are not afraid of BSE then so can beef.\nIf people did not eat beef then it would be likely they would stop eating anything associated with beef (eg milk and therefore cheese.) all dairy product sales would decrease, farmers would go bust, products would be wasted and the farmers would be after sane subsidies. Food would have to be imported thus replacing our own state of 'autarky' and costing the government money. Farmers would have to get rid of their stock at great expense and try and farm something else which would be suited to their land and area. A beef substitute would be created.\nThe government would be forced to carry out more extensive checks on beef and especially beef from 'mad cows'. The Ministry of Agriculture would be expected to clarify once and for all whether it was safe or not and then prove it to try and get people to eat beef again before it became too late. Extensive advertisement campaigns would be used by the government to get people to eat beef, but with a women dying and the doctors saying she died of mad cow disease, it doesnot help.","num_words":355}
